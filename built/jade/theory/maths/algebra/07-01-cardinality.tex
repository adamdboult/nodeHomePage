\subsection{Cardinality}

\subsubsection{Cardinality of cartesian product}

What about the cardinality of Cartesian products? So if we have sets:

$\{1,2,3\}$

$\{a,b\}$

We can have the Cartesian product set:

$\{(1,a),(2,a),(3,a),(1,b),(2,b),(3,b)\}$

We can see that:

$|A.B|=|A|.|B|$
\subsubsection{Cardinality of union and intersection}

$|A\lor B| = |A|+|B|-|A\land B|$
\subsubsection{Cardinality of powerset}

$|P(s)|=2^{|s|}$

\subsubsection{Cardinality of complement}

$|a \setminus b|=|a|-|a\land b|$

\subsubsection{Cardinality of even/odd natural numbers}

What about the cardinality of even numbers? Well, we can define a bijective function between each:

$f(n)=2n$

Similarly for odd numbers:

$f(n)=2n+1$

So these both have cardinality \(\aleph_0\).
