\subsection{Matrix representation}

\subsubsection{Representing linear maps as matrices}

We previously discsussed morphisms on vector spaces. We can write these as matrices.

Matrices represents transformations of vector spaces

\subsubsection{Representing vectors as matrices}

We can represent vectors as row or column matrices.

$v=\begin{bmatrix}a_{1} & a_{2}&...&a_{n}\end{bmatrix}$

$v=\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}\\a_{2}\\...\\a_{m}\end{bmatrix}$
