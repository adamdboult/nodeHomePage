\subsection{Commutation}

We define a function, the commuter, between two objects \(a\) and \(b\) as:

\([a,b]=ab-ba\)

For numbers, \(ab-ba=0\), however for matrices this is not generally true.

\subsection{Commutators and eigenvectors}

Consider two matrices which share an eigenvector \(v\).

\(Av=\lambda_A v\)

\(Bv=\lambda_B v\)

Now consider:

\(ABv=A\lambda_B v\)

\(ABv=\lambda_A\lambda_B v\)

\(BAv=\lambda_A\lambda_B v\)

If the matrices share all the same eigenvectors, then the matrices commute, and \(AB=BA\).
