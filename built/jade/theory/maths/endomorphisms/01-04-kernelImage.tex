\subsection{Kernels and images}

The kernel of a linear operator is the set of vectors such that:

\(Mv=0\)

The kernel is also called the nullspace.

This can be shown as \(\ker (M)\)

The image of a linear operator is the set of vectors \(w\) such that:

\(Mv=w\).

This can be shown as \(\Im (M)\)

We also know that:

\(\span (M)=\ker (M)+\im (M)\)
