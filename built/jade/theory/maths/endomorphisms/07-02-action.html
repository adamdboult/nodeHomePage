<h2 id="endomorphisms-as-group-actions"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Endomorphisms as group actions</h2>
<p>We can view each member of the group <span class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> as a homomorphim on <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>.</p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> is a vector space <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span>, the representation on each group member is an invertible square matrix.</p>
<p>If the set we use is the vector space <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span>, then we can represent each group element with a square matrix acting on <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span>.</p>
<p>Faithful means ab holds for repesentation too.</p>
<p>Representation theory. groups defined by ab=c. if we can match each eleemnt to amatrix where this holds we have represented the matrix.</p>
