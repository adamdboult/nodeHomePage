\subsection{Atomic formulae}

Atomic formulae are those without operators taking more than one input.

Literals, and negative literals, are types of atomic formula.

A literal is a formula with no operators.

\(\theta \)

These are also known as positive literals.

Negative literals are the negation of a literal.

\(\neg \theta \)

\subsection{Well-formed formulae}

A well-formed formula is one which can be given a truth value.

The following is not a well-formed formula:

$\theta \land $
