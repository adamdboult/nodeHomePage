\subsection{Resolution rule}

\subsubsection{Proof by resolution}

If we have a string of or statements, \(A\lor B\lor C\), and another which contains the completement of one element \(X\lor ¬B\lor Y\), we can infer:

\(A\lor C\lor X\lor Y\)

If the second statement has only one formula, then we have:

\(A\lor B\lor C\) and \(¬B\) implying \(A\lor C\)
