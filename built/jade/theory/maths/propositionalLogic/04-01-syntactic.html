<h2 id="substitution"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Substitution</h2>
<p>If we have a tautology, then we can substitute the formula of any propositional variable with any formula to arrive at any other tautology.</p>
<p>For example, we know that <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em> ∨ ¬<em>θ</em></span> is a tautology. This means that an arbitrary formula for <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is also a tautology.</p>
<p>An example is <span class="math inline">(<em>γ</em> ∧ <em>α</em>)∨¬(<em>γ</em> ∧ <em>α</em>)</span>, which we know is a tautology, without having to examine each variable.</p>
<h2 id="syntactic-consequence"><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Syntactic consequence</h2>
<p>Let us call the first formula <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and the second <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>. We can then say:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>A</em> ⊢ <em>B</em></span></p>
<p>This says that: if <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is true, then we can deduce that <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is true using steps such as substitution.</p>
<h2 id="modus-ponens"><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Modus Ponens</h2>
<p>Modus Ponens is a deduction rule. This allows us to use stpes other than substitution to derive new tautologies.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> implies <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is true, then <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is also true.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(<em>θ</em> → <em>γ</em>)∧<em>θ</em> ⇒ <em>γ</em></span></p>
<p>That is, if we can show that the following are true:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>θ</em> → <em>γ</em></span></p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span></p>
<p>We can infer that the following is also true:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span></p>
<h2 id="inference-with-horn-clauses"><span class="header-section-number">0.4</span> Inference with horn clauses</h2>
<p>If the horn clause is true, and so is the normal form part, then <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is also true.</p>
<p>As all inference with horn clauses uses Modus Ponens, it is sound.</p>
<p>Inference with horn clauses is also complete.</p>
<h2 id="theory"><span class="header-section-number">0.5</span> Theory</h2>
<p>Results derived from substitution or induction are called theorems. Theorems often divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Theorems - important results</p></li>
<li><p>Lemmas - results used for later theorems</p></li>
<li><p>Corollaries - readily deduced from a theorem</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We take a set of axioms, as true, and a deduction rule which enables us to derive additional formulae, or theorems. The collection of axioms and theorems is known as the theory.</p>
