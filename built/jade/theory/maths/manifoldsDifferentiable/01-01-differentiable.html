<h3 id="transition-map-recap">Transition map recap</h3>
<p>Given two charts with an overlap, we have a transition mapping between the two charts of the overlap, where the mapping corresponds to a position on the manifold.</p>
<h3 id="differentiable-transition-maps-1">Differentiable transition maps</h3>
<p>If this mapping is differentiable, we have a differentiable manifold.</p>
<h3 id="smooth-manifolds">Smooth manifolds</h3>
<p>If transition maps are smooth (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sup>âˆž</sup></span>) then the manifold is smooth.</p>
