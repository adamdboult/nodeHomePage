<h2 id="covariant-derivative"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Covariant derivative</h2>
<p>Essentially as we move across path, we are changing the basis.</p>
<p>We can look at how basis vector change as we translate</p>
<p>We can define as basis as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$e_i=\frac{\delta x}{\delta x_i}$</span></p>
<p>How to measure transport</p>
<p>If we take a vector and move it around a curved surface and return it to the same point, it may not face the same way</p>
<p>Eg if you’re on equator, move east, north, south to equator, you’ll face diffrent direction</p>
<p>This is true on smaller movements of a curved surface</p>
<p>We can use this to measure curvature of a manifold without coordinates</p>

<p>covariant derivative. how does change in field compare to parallel transport from curent position?</p>
<p>_v (X)=_<span>t0</span></p>
<p>We have point <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>. We can compare how field in tangent space varies in direction of <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>.</p>
<p>we don’t define basis as each point, but rather how basis changes as you move along a curve</p>
