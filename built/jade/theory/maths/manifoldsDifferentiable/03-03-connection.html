<p>If we have a tangent vector at one point of the manifold, we can map it to a tangent vector at a nearby point on the manifold.</p>
<p>We can use chain rule. so we can have coordinate maps where there is no overlap.</p>

<p>We have a vector in a tangent space</p>
<p>We have a curve on the manifold from the start point</p>
<p>As we “roll” the tangent, there is a unique vector in each new tangent, determined by transition map</p>
<p>These are affine transformations</p>
<p>Given two points, what path? what transfomration? if curuved then different paths will given different transformation.</p>
