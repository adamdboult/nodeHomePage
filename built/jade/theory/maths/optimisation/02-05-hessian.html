<h2 id="hessian-matrix">Hessian matrix</h2>
<p>We can take a function and make a matrix of its second order partial derivatives. This is the Hessian matrix, and it describes the local curvature of the function.</p>
<p>If the function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> has <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> parameters, the Hessian matrix is <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> × <em>n</em></span>, and is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$H_{ij}=\frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta x_i \delta x_j}$</span></p>
<p>If the function is convex, then the Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite for all points, and vice versa.</p>
<p>If the function is concave, then the Hessian matrix is negative semi-definite for all points, and vice versa.</p>
<p>We can diagnose critical points by evaluating the Hessian matrix at those points.</p>
<p>If it is positive definite, it is a local minimum. If it is negative definite it is a local maximum. If there are both positive and negative eigenvalues it is a saddle point.</p>
