<h2 id="slaters-condition"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Slater’s condition</h2>
<h3 id="strong-duality"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Strong duality</h3>
<p>Strong duality is where the duality gap is <span class="math inline">0</span>.</p>
<h3 id="slaters-condition-1"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Slater’s condition</h3>
<p>Slater’s condition says that strong duality holds if there is an input where the inequality constraints are satisified strictly.</p>
<p>That is they are <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)&lt;0</span>, not <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)≤0</span></p>
<p>This means that the conditions are slack.</p>
<p>This only applies if the problem is convex. That is, if Slater’s condition holds, and the problem is convex, then strong duality holds.</p>
