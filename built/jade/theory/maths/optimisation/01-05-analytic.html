<p>Convex functions only have one minimum, and concave functions have only one maximum.</p>
<p>If a function is not concave or convex, it may have multiple minima</p>
<p>If a function is convex, then there is only one critical point – the local minimum. We can identify this this by looking for critical points using first-order conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a function is concave, then there is only one critical point – the local maximum.</p>
<p>We can identify whether a function is concave or convex by evaluating the Hessian matrix.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-multiple-local-optima"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Evaluating multiple local optima</h3>
<p>We can evaluate each of the local minima or maxima, and compare the sizes.</p>
<p>We can identify these by taking partial derivatives of the function in question and identifying where this function is equal to zero.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>u</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">$u_{x_i}=\frac{\delta f}{\delta x_i}=0$</span></p>
<p>We can then solve this bundle of equations to find the stationary values of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
<p>After identifying the vector <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> for these points we can then determine whether or not the points are minima or maxima by examining the second derivative at these points. If it is positive it is a local minima, and therefore not an optimal point. Points beyond these will be higher, and may be higher than any local maxima.</p>
