<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>We want to identify either the maximum or the minimum.</p>
<p>There exist local minima and global minima.</p>
<h3 id="optimising-through-limits">Optimising through limits</h3>
<p>If we are looking to minimise a function, and the limits are <span class="math inline">∞</span> or <span class="math inline">−∞</span> then we can optimise by taking large or small values.</p>
<p>We can examine this for each variable.</p>
<p>This also applies for maximising a function.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation-through-stationary-points">Optimisation through stationary points</h3>
<p>Stationary points of a function are points where marginal changes do not have an impact on the value of the function. As a result they are either local maxima or minima.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation-through-algorithms">Optimisation through algorithms</h3>
<p>If we cannot identify stationary points easily, we can instead use algorithms to identify optima.</p>
<h3 id="stationary-points-of-strictly-concave-and-convex-functions">Stationary points of strictly concave and convex functions</h3>
<p>If a function is strictly concave it will only have one stationary point, a local, and global, maxima.</p>
<p>If a function is strictly convex it will only have one stationary point, a local, and global, minima.</p>
