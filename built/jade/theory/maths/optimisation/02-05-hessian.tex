\subsection{Hessian matrix}

We can take a function and make a matrix of its second order partial derivatives.  This is the Hessian matrix, and it describes the local curvature of the function.

If the function \(f\) has \(n\) parameters, the Hessian matrix is \(n\times n\), and is defined as:

\(H_{ij}=\frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta x_i \delta x_j}\)

If the function is convex, then the Hessian matrix is positive semi-definite for all points, and vice versa.

If the function is concave, then the Hessian matrix is negative semi-definite for all points, and vice versa.

We can diagnose critical points by evaluating the Hessian matrix at those points.

If it is positive definite, it is a local minimum. If it is negative definite it is a local maximum. If there are both positive and negative eigenvalues it is a saddle point.
