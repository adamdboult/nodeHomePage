<h2 id="homomorphisms-form-a-vector-space"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Homomorphisms form a vector space</h2>
<p>If we can can show that scalars can act on morphisms, then we can shwn that morphisms on a vector space are themselves a vector space.</p>
<p>Scalars can act on morphisms, and so morphisms of vector spaces are themselves vector spaces.</p>
<h3 id="dimensions-of-homomorphisms"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Dimensions of homomorphisms</h3>
<p>We can identify the dimensionality of this new vector space from the dimensions of the original vector spaces.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">dim(hom(<em>V</em>, <em>W</em>)) = dim <em>V</em>dim <em>W</em></span></p>
