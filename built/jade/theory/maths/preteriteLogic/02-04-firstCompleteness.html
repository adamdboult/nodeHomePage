<h3 id="completeness-of-first-order-logic">Completeness of first-order logic</h3>
<p>We previously showed that zero-order logic was complete. What about first-order logic?</p>
<p>Gödel’s’ completeness theorem says that for first order logic, a theory can include all tautologies, the first category.</p>
<p>If the completeness theorem is true and a formula is not in the theory, then the formula is either refutable or satisfiable under some, but not all interpretations.</p>
<p>That is, either the theory will contain <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>, <span class="math inline">¬<em>θ</em></span>, or <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> will be satisfiable in some but not all interpretations, and neither will be in the in theory.</p>
<p>To prove this we look for a proof that every formula is either refutable or true under some structure. So for an arbitrary formula <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> we want to show it is either refutable or satisfiable under some interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-converting-the-form-of-the-formula">Part 1: Converting the form of the formula</h3>
<p>Remove free variables, functions</p>
<p>Note that if this is true, all valid formulae of the form below are provable:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">¬<em>θ</em></span></p>
<p>This means that there is no interpretation where the following is true:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span></p>
<p>Conversely if <span class="math inline">¬<em>θ</em></span> is not in the theory, then <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> must be true under some interpretation.</p>
<p>That is, if all valid formulae are provable, then all</p>
<p>Reformulating the question:</p>
<p>This is the most basic form of the completeness theorem. We immediately restate it in a form more convenient for our purposes:</p>
<p>Theorem 2. Every formula φ is either refutable or satisfiable in some structure.</p>
<p>“<span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>is refutable” means by definition “<span class="math inline">¬<em>θ</em></span> is provable”.</p>
<h3 id="decidability">Decidability</h3>
<p>Given a formula, can we find out if can be derived from the axioms? We can follow a process for doing so which would inform us if the formula was or was not a theorem. Alternative, the process could carry on forever.</p>
<p>If the process never carries on forever the system is decidable: there is a finite process to determine whether the formula is in or out. If the process halts for true formulas, but can carry on forever for false formulas, the system is semi-decidable. If the process takes a long time, we do not know if it is looping infinitely, or approaching its halt point.</p>
<p>Intuitively, use of axioms can make an existing formula shorter or longer, so finding all short formulas can require going forwards and backwards an infinite number of times.</p>
