\subsection{Functions and brackets}

\subsubsection{Functions (or maps)}

Functions take other terms, and are themselves terms. For example if we wanted to know if someone can legally drive in a specific country, we could use:

$P(you,age(UK))$

A function may not be able to produce an output for all inputs. For examples \(age(green)\) has no interpretation.

Functions can also take different numbers of inputs. Constants, such as “you” and “UK” can be shown as functions with \(0\) inputs. As a result we could instead write:

$P(you(),age(UK()))$

We generally denote functions with a lower case letter, so would instead write:

$P(y(),a(b()))$

Functions are also called maps.
