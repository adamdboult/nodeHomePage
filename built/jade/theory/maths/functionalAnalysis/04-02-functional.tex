\subsection{Functionals}

Functionals map functions to scalars. They are the \(1\)-forms of infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

If we have a function \(f\), we can write functional \(J[f]\).

\subsubsection{More}

We can define neighbourhoods around a function \(f\). For example, taking \(y\) to be \(f\) with infintesimal changes. to each of the values.

The difference between the functional at both points is

\(\delta J=J[y]-J[f]\)

\subsubsection{Extrema}

If

\(\delta J=J[y]-J[f]\)

is the same sign for all y around f, then J has an extremum at f.

\subsubsection{Functional derivatives}
