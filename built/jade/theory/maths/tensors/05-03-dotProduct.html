<h3 id="dot-product-is-a-bilinear-form">Dot product is a bilinear form</h3>
<p>This is a bilinear form, a mapping from two vectors in the same vector space to the underlying field.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>V</em> × <em>V</em> → <em>F</em></span></p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-dot-product">Calculating the dot product</h3>
<p>This is calculated by multiplying each matching element, and summing the results.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$u\cdot v =\sum_{i=1}^nu_iv_i$</span></p>
<h3 id="dot-product-on-the-complex-numbers">Dot product on the complex numbers</h3>
<p>Properties don’t hold. Can get zero vectors from non-zero inputs. Get complex numbers from dot product on itself.</p>
<p>Inner products better deal with complex number fields. However they are not bilinear maps.</p>
