\subsection{Kronecker product}

The Kronecker product takes the concept of the outer product and applies to to matrices.

We can essentially repace every element in the matrix on the left with the element multiplied by the entire matrix on the right.

Like outer products, Kronecker products are written as:

\(\u\otimes v=w\)
