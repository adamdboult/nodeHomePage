\subsection{The Lorentz group}

The Lorentz group is the \(O(1,3)\) group.
\subsubsection{Symmetries of the Lorentz group}

We can do the usual \(3\) rotations, however there are additional \(3\) symmetries, making the Lorzentz group \(6\)-dimensional.

These are the Lorentz boosts.

A symmetry has:

\(t'^2-x'2-y'^2-z'^2=t^2-x^2-y^2-z^2\)

We consider the case wherewe just boost on \(x\), so \(y=y'\) and \(z=z'\).

\(t'^2-x'2=t^2-x^2\)

Or with \(c\):

\(c^2t'^2-x'2=t^2-x^2\)
