<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="rings">Rings</h2>
<p>Consider an abelian group <span class="math inline">(<em>S</em>, +)</span>.</p>
<p>A ring takes this and adds a multiplicative function which satisfies the distributive property.</p>
<p>Groups have an identity element for their function. Rings must have identity elements for both their functions.</p>
<p>The multiplicative function does not have to be a bijection. For example the set of integers, addition and multiplication form a ring.</p>
<h2 id="rngs">Rngs</h2>
<p>A rng is a ring without the multiplicative identity (hense no ’i’).</p>
<h1 id="commutation">Commutation</h1>
<h2 id="commutative-rings">Commutative rings</h2>
<p>The multiplication operation commutes.</p>
<h2 id="commutator">Commutator</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">[<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>]=<em>a</em><em>b</em> − <em>b</em><em>a</em></span></p>
<h2 id="the-jacobi-identity">The Jacobi identity</h2>
<h1 id="examples-of-rings">Examples of rings</h1>
<h2 id="zero-trivial-ring">Zero (trivial) ring</h2>
<p>The trivial ring is a ring with just one element.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">0</span> with addition and multiplication work.</p>
<h2 id="integer-rings">Integer rings</h2>
<p>The integers with addition and multiplication form a ring.</p>
<h2 id="integer-mod-n-rings">Integer mod <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> rings</h2>
<p>The integers mod <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> with addition and multiplication form a group.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>The integers <span class="math inline">{1, 2, 3}</span> form a ring.</p>
<h1 id="properties-of-rings">Properties of rings</h1>
<h2 id="characteristic-of-a-ring">Characteristic of a ring</h2>
<p>The characteristic of a ring is the number of times the multiplicative identity must be added to get the additive identity.</p>
<p>If this never happens, the characteristic is <span class="math inline">0</span>.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>The integer mod <span class="math inline">2</span> ring, the characteristic is <span class="math inline">2</span>.</p>
<h1 id="division">Division</h1>
<h2 id="division-rings">Division rings</h2>
<p>A divison ring is a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>The rational numbers are a divison ring.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-between-divison-rings-and-fields">Relationship between divison rings and fields</h3>
<p>Fields (not yet introduced) are different from division rings only in that multiplication for a field must be commutative.</p>
<h2 id="units">Units</h2>
<p>A unit is an element of a ring which has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>
<p>The ring of integers with addition and multiplication, only <span class="math inline">−1</span> and <span class="math inline">1</span> are units, as both have multiplicative inverses in the ring.</p>
<h1 id="subrings">Subrings</h1>
<h2 id="subrings-1">Subrings</h2>
<p>A subring is a subset of the ring, where the addition and multiplication operations on the subring result in elements also in the subring.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example</h3>
<p>The even numbers are a subring of the integers.</p>
<h2 id="ideals">Ideals</h2>
<p>An ideal is a subring where the multiplication of any element of the ideal with any element of the ring is also in the ideal.</p>
<h3 id="examples-2">Examples</h3>
<p>Even numbers are an ideal of the integers.</p>
<p>Odd numbers are not an ideal. For example <span class="math inline">1</span> is in the ideal, but multiplied by <span class="math inline">2</span> gives <span class="math inline">2</span>, which is not in the ideal.</p>
