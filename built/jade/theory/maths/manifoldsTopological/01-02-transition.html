<h2 id="transition-maps">Transition maps</h2>
<p>Where two charts overlap we can express the points where the charts overlap as two different coordinates.</p>
<p>We can express the mapping from these coordinates as a function. This is a transition map.</p>

<p>If two charts cover some of the same points on a manifold then we can define a function for those points where we move from one vector to another.</p>
<p>We can represent moving between charts as:</p>
