<h2 id="manifolds-charts-and-atlases">Manifolds, charts and atlases</h2>
<p>A manifold is a set of points and associated charts.</p>
<p>A chart is a mapping from each point in a subset of the manifold to a point in a vector space.</p>
<p>These charts are invertible. If we are given coordinates, we can identify the point in the manifold it comes from.</p>
<h3 id="example-the-sphere">Example: The sphere</h3>
<p>We can map a hemisphere to a subset of <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>. Given a point in <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> we can identify a specific point on the hemisphere, and given a s specific point on the hemisphere we can identify a point in <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<h3 id="universal-charts">Universal charts</h3>
<p>If the vector space is flat and non-repeating, then a single chart can be used to map the whole manifold.</p>
<h3 id="atlases">Atlases</h3>
<p>If we have a collection of charts which covers each point needs to be covered at least once, we have an atlas. Each chart needs to be to the same dimensional vector space.</p>
