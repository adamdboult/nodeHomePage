<h2 id="vector-bundles">Vector bundles</h2>
<p>A vector bundle consists of a base manifold (a base space), and a real vector space at each point in the base manifold.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>For example we can have a base manifold of a circle, and have a <span class="math inline">1</span>-dimensional vector space at each point on the circle to create an infinitely extended cylinder.</p>
