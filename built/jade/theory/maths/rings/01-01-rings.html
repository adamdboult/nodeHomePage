<h2 id="rings"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Rings</h2>
<p>Consider an abelian group <span class="math inline">(<em>S</em>,â€†+)</span>.</p>
<p>A ring takes this and adds a multiplicative function which satisfies the distributive property.</p>
<p>Groups have an identity element for their function. Rings must have identity elements for both their functions.</p>
<p>The multiplicative function does not have to be a bijection. For example the set of integers, addition and multiplication form a ring.</p>
