<h2 id="division-rings"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Division rings</h2>
<p>A divison ring is a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
<h3 id="example"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Example</h3>
<p>The rational numbers are a divison ring.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-between-divison-rings-and-fields"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Relationship between divison rings and fields</h3>
<p>Fields (not yet introduced) are different from division rings only in that multiplication for a field must be commutative.</p>
