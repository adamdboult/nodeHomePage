<h2 id="ideals"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Ideals</h2>
<p>An ideal is a subring where the multiplication of any element of the ideal with any element of the ring is also in the ideal.</p>
<h3 id="examples"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Examples</h3>
<p>Even numbers are an ideal of the integers.</p>
<p>Odd numbers are not an ideal. For example <span class="math inline">1</span> is in the ideal, but multiplied by <span class="math inline">2</span> gives <span class="math inline">2</span>, which is not in the ideal.</p>
