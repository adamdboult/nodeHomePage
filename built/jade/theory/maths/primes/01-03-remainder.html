<p>Division is defined between natural numbers. However there are many cases where this division does not map to a natural number. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\frac{7}{3}$</span></p>
<p>We can divide <span class="math inline">6</span> of the <span class="math inline">7</span> by <span class="math inline">3</span>, giving <span class="math inline">2</span> with <span class="math inline">1</span> remaining.</p>
<p>Alternatively we can divide <span class="math inline">3</span> of the <span class="math inline">7</span> by <span class="math inline">3</span>, giving <span class="math inline">1</span> with <span class="math inline">4</span> remaining</p>
<p>Or we could divide <span class="math inline">0</span> of the <span class="math inline">7</span> by <span class="math inline">3</span> giving <span class="math inline">0</span> with <span class="math inline">7</span> remaining.</p>
<p>The remainder refers to the lowest possible number - in this case <span class="math inline">1</span>.</p>
