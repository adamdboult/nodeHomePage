\subsection{Residue systems}

\subsubsection{Least residue system modulo \(n\)}

This is the set of numbers from \(0\) to \(n-1\).

\subsubsection{Complete residue system}

This a set of numbers none of which are congruent \(\mod n\). That is, for no pair \(\{a,b\}\) does \(a \mod(n)=b mod(n)\)

\subsubsection{Reduced residue system}

This is a complete residue system where all numbers are relatively prime to \(n\).
