<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>A prime number is a number which does not have any divisors other than <span class="math inline">1</span> and itself.</p>
<p>By convention we do not refer to <span class="math inline">0</span> or <span class="math inline">1</span> as prime numbers.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-prime-numbers">Identifying prime numbers</h3>
<p>Divisors must be smaller than the number. As a result it is easy to identify early prime numbers, as we can try to divide by all preceding numbers.</p>

<h3 id="composite-numbers">Composite numbers</h3>
<p>Composite numbers are numbers that are made up through the multiplication of other numbers.</p>
<p>They are not prime.</p>
