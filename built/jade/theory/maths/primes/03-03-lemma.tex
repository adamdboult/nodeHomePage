\subsection{Euclid's lemma}

\subsubsection{Statement}

If a prime number \(p\) divides product \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least of one of \(a\) or \(b\).

\subsubsection{Proof}

From Bezout's identity we know that:

$d=px+by$

Where \(p\) and \(b\) are natural numbers and \(d\) is their greatest common denominator.

Let's choose a prime number for \(p\). There are no common divisors, other than one. As a result there are exist values for \(x\) and \(y\) such that:

$1=px+by$

Now, we are trying to prove that if \(p\) divides \(a.b\) then \(p\) must divide at least one of \(a\) and \(b\), so let's multiply this by \(a\).

$a=pax+aby$

We know that \(p\) divides \(pax\), and \(p\) divides \(ab\) by definition. As a result \(p\) can divide \(a\).
