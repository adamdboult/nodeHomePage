<h2 id="lagranges-theorem"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Lagrange’s theorem</h2>
<p>Lagrange’s theorem states that for any finite group <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>, the order of every subgroup is a divisor of the order of <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.</p>
<p>Consider subset <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>. We know that all cosets are disjoint, and that the union of all cosets is <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.</p>
<p>As cosets are the same size, we know that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">|<em>G</em>|=<em>m</em>|<em>H</em>|</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the number of cosets.</p>
<p>This means that if a group has order <span class="math inline">10</span>, a subgroup must have order <span class="math inline">1</span>, <span class="math inline">2</span> <span class="math inline">5</span> or <span class="math inline">10</span>.</p>
