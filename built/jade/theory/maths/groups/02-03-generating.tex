\subsection{Generating sets}

We can define a group through a generating set and an operation.

And define the group as \(G=< S >\)

\subsection{Finite groups}

Consider the set of natural numbers and addition modulo 4. This forms a group containing:

\(\{0,1,2,3\}\)

This can be written as \(Z_4\) or more generally as \(Z_n\), or \(Z/nZ\).
