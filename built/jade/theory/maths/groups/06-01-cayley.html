<h2 id="cayleys-theorem">Cayley’s theorem</h2>
<p>Cayley’s theorem states that every group <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.</p>
<p>Multiplication by a member of <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> is a bijective function, as for each <span class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> there is also a <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sup>−1</sup></span>.</p>
<p>This means that multiplication of each member of <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> is a permutation, and so is a subset of the symmetric group on <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.</p>
