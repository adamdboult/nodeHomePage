<p>A permutation is defined as a bijection from a set to itself.</p>
<p>For a set of size <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, the number of permutations is <span class="math inline"><em>n</em>!</span>. This is because there are <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> possibilities for the first item, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> for the second and so on.</p>
<h3 id="the-symmetric-group"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> The symmetric group</h3>
<p>The set of all permutations forms a group, the symmetric group. This forms a group because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is an identity element</p></li>
<li><p>Each combination of permutations is also in the group.</p></li>
<li><p>Each permutation has an inverse in the group.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="permutation-groups"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Permutation groups</h3>
<p>A subgroup of the symmetric group is called a permutation group.</p>
