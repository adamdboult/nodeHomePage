\subsection{Lie algebra of \(SU(n)\)}

\subsubsection{\(SU(n)\) forms a Lie group}

\subsubsection{Lie algebra of \(SU(n)\)}

The Lie algebra of \U(n)\) is defined as:

\(\mathfrak{su}(n)=\{X\in \mathbb {C}^{n\times n}|e^{tX}\in SU(n) \forall t\in \mathbb{R}\}\)

This is satisfied by the skew-Hermitian matrices where \(M=-M^*\) and the trace is \(0\). Note that this means the diagonals are all \(0\) or pure imaginary.
