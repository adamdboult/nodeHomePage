<p>We can write vectors as combinations of other vectors.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>v</em> = ∑<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>α</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>v</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span></p>
<p>A subset which spans the vector space, and which is also linearly independent, is a basis of the vector space.</p>
<p>For an arbitrary vector of size <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, we cannot use less than <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> elementary vectors. We could use more, but these would be redundant.</p>
<p>If we use <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> elementary vectors, there is a unique solution of weights of elementary vectors.</p>
<p>If we use more than <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> elementary vectors, there will be linear dependence, and so there will not be a unique solution.</p>
