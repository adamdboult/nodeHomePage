\subsection{Metric compatibility}

If we have two vectors in the tangent space of a manifold with a metric tensor, we can get a scalar:

\(v^iu^jg_{ij}\)

\subsubsection{Transported metric}

If we transport two vectors along a connection, we have the metric at the new point.

\subsubsection{Metric preserving connections}

If the connection preserves the metric, then the connection is metric compatible.
