\subsection{Topologies on sets}

\(T\) is a topology on set \(X\) if:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(X\in T\)
\item \(\varnothing \in T\)
\item Unions of \(T\) are in \(T\)
\item Intersections of \(T\) are in \(T\)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Examples of topologies: The trivial topology}

The trivial topology contains only the underlying set and the empty set.

\subsection{Examples of topologies: The discrete toplogy}

The discrete toplogy contains all subsets of the underlying set (is this the power set?)
