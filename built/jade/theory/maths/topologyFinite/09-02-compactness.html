<h2 id="compact-spaces">Compact spaces</h2>
<p>A space <span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> is compact if each open cover has a finite subcover.</p>
<p>If we can define a cover which does not have a finite subcover, then the space is not compact.</p>
<p>For example an infinite cover could be tend towards <span class="math inline">(0, 1)</span>, eg as <span class="math inline">$\dfrac{1}{n},1-\dfrac{1}{n}$</span></p>
<p>This covers <span class="math inline">(0, 1)</span>, but there is no finite subcover. As a result <span class="math inline">(0, 1)</span> is not compact.</p>
