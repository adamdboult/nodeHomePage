<h2 id="vertices-and-edges"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Vertices and edges</h2>
<p>A graph is a set of vertices <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span>, a set of edges E which are subset of pairs from V.</p>
<p>undirected so each edge is a set</p>
<h3 id="degree-of-a-vertex"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Degree of a vertex</h3>
<p>The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connections to it.</p>
