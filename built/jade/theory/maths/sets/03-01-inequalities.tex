\subsection{Inequalities}

\subsubsection{Less than or equal}

Orderings define relations between elements in a set, where one element can preceed the other. 

Orderings are antisymmetric. That is, the only case where the relation is satisfied in both directions is if the elements are equal.

$(a\le b)\land (b\le a)\rightarrow (a=b)$

Orderings are transitive. That is: 

$(a\le b)\land (b\le c)\rightarrow (a\le c)$

\subsubsection{Greater than or equal}

\subsubsection{Less than and greater than}

The relation \(\le \) is refered to as non-strict.

There is a similar strict relation relation, \(<\):

$(a\le b)\land Â¬(b\le a)\rightarrow (a < b)$
