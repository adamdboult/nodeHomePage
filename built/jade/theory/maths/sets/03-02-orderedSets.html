<h2 id="ordered-sets"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Ordered sets</h2>
<h3 id="totally-ordered-sets"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.1</span> Totally ordered sets</h3>
<p>A totally ordered set is one where the relation is defined on all pairs:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∀<em>a</em>∀<em>b</em>(<em>a</em> ≤ <em>b</em>)∨(<em>b</em> ≤ <em>a</em>)</span></p>
<p>Note that totality implies reflexivity.</p>
<h3 id="partially-ordered-sets-poset"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Partially ordered sets (poset)</h3>
<p>A partially ordered set, or poset, is one where the relation is defined between each element and itself.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∀<em>a</em>(<em>a</em> ≤ <em>a</em>)</span></p>
<p>That is, every element is related to itself.</p>
<p>These are also called posets.</p>
<h3 id="well-ordering"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.3</span> Well-ordering</h3>
<p>A well-ordering on a set is a total order on the set where the set contains a minimum number. For example the relation <span class="math inline">≤</span> on the natural numbers is a well-ordering because <span class="math inline">0</span> is the minimum.</p>
<p>The relation <span class="math inline">≤</span> on the integers however is not a well-ordering, as there is no minimum number in the set.</p>
