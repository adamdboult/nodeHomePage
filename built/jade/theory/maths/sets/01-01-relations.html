<p>Say we have a preterite <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> which is true for some values of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Sets allow us to explore the properties of these values.</p>
<p>We may want to talk about a collection of terms for which <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is true, which we call a set.</p>
<p>To do this we need to introduce new axioms, however first we can add (conservative) definitions to help us do this.</p>
<p>We introduce a new relation: membership. If element <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is in set <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> then the following relation is true, otherwise it is false:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>x</em> ∈ <em>s</em></span></p>
<p>Sets are also terms. In first-order logic they will be included in quantifiers. Indeed, in set theory, we aim to treat everything as sets.</p>
<p>If a term is not a member of another term, we can write this using the non-member relation as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∀<em>x</em>∀<em>s</em>[¬(<em>x</em> ∈ <em>s</em>)↔<em>x</em> ∉ <em>s</em>]</span></p>
