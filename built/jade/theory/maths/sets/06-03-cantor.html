<h2 id="cantors-theorem">Cantors theorem</h2>
<p>The cardinality of the powerset is strictly greater than the cardinality of the underlying set.</p>
<p>That is, <span class="math inline">|<em>P</em>(<em>s</em>)| &lt; |<em>s</em>|</span>.</p>
<p>This applies to finite sets and infinite sets. In particular, this means that the powerset of the natural numbers is bigger than the natural numbers.</p>
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>If one set is at least as big as another, then then is a surjection from that set to the other.</p>
<p>That is, if we can prove that there is no surjection from a set to its powerset, then we have proved the theorem.</p>
<p>We consider <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span>. If there is a surjection, then for every subset of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> there should be a mapping from <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> to that subset.</p>
<p>We take set <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and have the powerset of this, <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>s</em>)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the set:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>A</em> = {<em>x</em> ∈ <em>s</em>|<em>x</em> ∉ <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)}</span></p>
<p>That is, the set of all elements of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> which do not map to the surjection.</p>
