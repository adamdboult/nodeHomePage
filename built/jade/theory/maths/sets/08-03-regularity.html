<h2 id="axiom-of-regularity">Axiom of regularity</h2>
<p>The axiom of regularity states that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∀<em>x</em>[<em>x</em> ≠ ⌀ → ∃<em>y</em> ∈ <em>x</em>(<em>y</em> ∧ <em>x</em>)=⌀]</span></p>
<p>That is, for all non-empty sets, there is an element of the set which is disjoint from the set itself.</p>
<p>This means that no set can be a member of itself.</p>
