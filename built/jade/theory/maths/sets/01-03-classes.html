<h2 id="equivalence-classes"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Equivalence classes</h2>
<p>We have already ready defined the relationship equality, between terms.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may wish to talk about a collection of terms which are all equal to each other. This is an equivalence class.</p>
<p>Though we have not yet defined it, integers are example of this. For example <span class="math inline">−1</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">0 − 1</span>, <span class="math inline">1 − 2</span> and so on.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∀<em>y</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>x</em><em>x</em> = <em>y</em> → <em>x</em> ∈ <em>z</em></span></p>
<p>For all sets, we can call the class of all sets equal to the set an equivalence class.</p>
<p>This does not necessarily exist.</p>
