<h2 id="gradient"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Gradient</h2>
<p>In a scalar field we can calculate the partial derivative at any point with respect to one input.</p>
<p>We may wish to consider these collectively. To do that we use the gradient operator.</p>
<p>We previously introduced the Del operator where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\nabla =(\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\frac{\delta }{\delta x_i})$</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> are the basis vectors.</p>
<p>This on its own means nothing. It is similar to the partial differentiation function.</p>
<p>We now multiply Del by the function. This gives us:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\nabla f=(\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\frac{\delta f}{\delta x_i})$</span>. This gives us a vector in the underlying vector space.</p>
<p>This is the gradient.</p>
