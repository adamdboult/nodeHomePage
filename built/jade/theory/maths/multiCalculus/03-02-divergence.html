<h2 id="divergence">Divergence</h2>
<p>This takes a vector field and produces a scalar field.</p>
<p>It is the dot product of the vector field with the del operator.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>v</em><em>F</em> = ∇.<em>F</em></span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">$\nabla =(\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\frac{\delta }{\delta x_i})$</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">$div F = \sum_{i=1}^n e_i\frac{\delta F_i}{\delta x_i}$</span></p>
<h3 id="divergence-as-net-flow">Divergence as net flow</h3>
<p>Divergence can be thought of as the net flow into a point.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a body of water, and a vector field as the velocity at any given point, then the divergence is <span class="math inline">0</span> at all points.</p>
<p>This is because water is incompressible, and so there can be no net flows.</p>
<p>Areas which flow out are sources, while areas that flow inwards are sinks.</p>
<h3 id="solenoidal-vector-fields">Solenoidal vector fields</h3>
<p>If there is no divergence, then the vector field is called solenoidal.</p>
