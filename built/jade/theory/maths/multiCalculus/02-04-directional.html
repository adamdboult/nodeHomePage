<h2 id="directional-derivative">Directional derivative</h2>
<p>We have a function, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<strong>x</strong>)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a vector <span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>, we can identify by how much this scalar function changes as you move in that direction.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\nabla_v f(x):=\lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(\mathbf x+\delta \mathbf v)-f(\mathbf x) }{\delta }$</span></p>
<p>The directional derivative is the same dimension as underlying field.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>Differentiation of scalar field, <span class="math inline"><em>d</em><em>f</em></span>, can be defined as a vector field where grad is 0. can differ with orientation, scale</p>
