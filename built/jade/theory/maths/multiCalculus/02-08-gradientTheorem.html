<h2 id="gradient-theorem"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Gradient theorem</h2>
<p>In a scalar field, the line integral of the gradient field is the difference between the value of the scalar field at the start and end points.</p>
<p>This generalises the fundamental theorem of calclulus.</p>
