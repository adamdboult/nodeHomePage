<h2 id="curves-and-closed-curves">Curves and closed curves</h2>
<p>In a space we can identify a curve between two points. If the input in the real numbers then this curve is unique.</p>
<p>For more general scalar fields this will not be the case. Two points in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span> could be joined by an infinite number of paths.</p>
<p>A curve can be defined as a function on the real numbers. The curve itself is totally ordered, and homogenous to the real number line.</p>
<p>We can write the curve therefore as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>r</em> : [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>]→<em>C</em></span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> are the start and end points of the curve, and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is the resulting curve.</p>
<h3 id="closed-curves">Closed curves</h3>
<p>If the start and end point of the curve are the same then the curve is closed. We can write this as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">∮<sub><em>C</em></sub><em>f</em>(<em>r</em>)<em>d</em><em>s</em> = ∫<sub><em>a</em></sub><sup><em>b</em></sup><em>f</em>(<em>r</em>(<em>t</em>))|<em>r</em>′(<em>t</em>)|<em>d</em><em>t</em></span></p>
