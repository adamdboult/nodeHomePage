\subsection{Incompleteness of the real numbers}

\subsubsection{The square root of \(2\) is not a rational number}

Let's prove there are numbers which are not rational. Consider \(\sqrt 2\) and let's show that it being rational leads to a contradiction.

$\sqrt 2=\frac{x}{y}$

$2=\frac{x^2}{y^2}$

$2y^2=x^2$

So we know that \(x^2\) is even, and can be shown as \(x=2n\).

$2y^2=(2n)^2$

$y^2=2n^2$

So \(y\) is even. But if both \(x\) and \(y\) are even, then the fraction was not reduced.

This presents a contraction so the original statement must have been false.

So we know there isn't a rational solution to \(\sqrt 2\).
