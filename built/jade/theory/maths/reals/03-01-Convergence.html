<h3 id="cauchy-sequence">Cauchy sequence</h3>
<p>A cauchy sequence is a sequence such that for an any arbitrarily small number <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>, there is a point in the sequence where all possible pairs after this are even closer together.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">(∀<em>ϵ</em> &gt; 0)(∃<em>N</em> ∈ ℕ : ∀<em>m</em>, <em>n</em> ∈ ℕ &gt; <em>N</em>)(|<em>a</em><sub><em>m</em></sub> − <em>a</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>|&lt;<em>ϵ</em>)</span></p>
<p>This last term gives a distance between two entries. In addition to the number line, this could be used on vectors, where distances are defined.</p>
<p>As a example, <span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{n}$</span> is a cauchy sequence, <span class="math inline">$\sum_i \frac{1}{n}$</span> is not.</p>
<h3 id="completeness">Completeness</h3>
<p>Cauchy sequences can be defined on some given set. For example given all the numbers between <span class="math inline">0</span> and <span class="math inline">1</span> there are any number of different cauchy sequences converging at some point.</p>
<p>If it is possible to define a cauchy sequence on a set where the limit is not in the set, then the set is incomplete.</p>
<p>For example, the numbers between <span class="math inline">0</span> and <span class="math inline">1</span> but not including <span class="math inline">0</span> and <span class="math inline">1</span> are not complete. It is possible to define sequences which converge to these missing points.</p>
<p>More abstractly, you could have all vectors where <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> &lt; 1</span>. This is incomplete (or open) as sequences on these vectors can converge to limits not in the set.</p>
<p>Cauchy sequences are important when considering real numbers. We could define a sequence converging on <span class="math inline">$\sqrt 2$</span>, but as this number is not in the set, it is incomplete.</p>
