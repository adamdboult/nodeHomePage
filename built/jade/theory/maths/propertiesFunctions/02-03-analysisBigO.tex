\subsection{Big \(O\) and little-\(o\) notation}

\subsubsection{Big \(O\) notation}

In big \(O\) notation we are interested in t he size of a function as it getes larger. We ignore constant multiples.

\(cx\in O(x)\)

And addition of constants.

\(cx+b\in O(x)\)

If there are two terms and one is larger, we keep the largest.

\(x+x^2\in O(x^2)\)

More generally we write:

\(f(x)\in O(g(x))\)

\subsubsection{Little-\(o\) notation}
