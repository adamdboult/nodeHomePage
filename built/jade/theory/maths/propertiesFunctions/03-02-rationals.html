<h2 id="reals-or-rationals-for-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Reals or rationals for analysis</h2>
<p>Why can’t we use rationals for analysis?</p>
<p>If discontinous at not rational number, it can still be continous for all rationals.</p>
<p>eg f(x)=-1 unless x^2&gt;2, where f(x)=1</p>
<p>Continous for all rationals, because rationals dense in reals</p>
<p>But can’t be differentiated</p>
