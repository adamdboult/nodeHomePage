<p>A differentiable function is one where the differential is defined at all points on the real line.</p>
<p>All differentiable functions are continuous. Not all continuous functions are differentiable.</p>
<h3 id="differentiability-class"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.2</span> Differentiability class</h3>
<p>We can describe a function with its differentiability class. If a function can be differentiated <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> times and these differentials are all continous, then the function is class <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sup><em>n</em></sup></span>.</p>
<h3 id="smooth-functions"><span class="header-section-number">0.1.3</span> Smooth functions</h3>
<p>If a function can be differentiated infinitely many times to produce continous functions, it is <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sup>âˆž</sup></span>, or smooth.</p>
