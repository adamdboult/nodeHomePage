\subsubsection{Linear ODEs}

For some we can write:

\(\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y)\)

\(\frac{dy}{dt}=q(t)-p(t)y\)

This can be solved by multiplying by an unknown function \(\mu (t)\):

\(\frac{dy}{dt}+p(t)y=q(t)\)

\(\mu (t)[\frac{dy}{dt}+p(t)y]=\mu (t)q(t)\)

We can then set \(\mu(t)=e^{\int p(t)dt}\). This means that \(\frac{d\mu }{dt}=p(t)u(t)\)

\(\frac{d}{dt}[\mu(t)y]=\mu (t)q(t)\)

\(\mu(t)y=\int \mu (t)q(t)dt + C\)

In some cases, this can then be solved.

\subsubsection{Example}

\(\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=cy\)

\(y=Ae^{c(y+a)}\)


\(\frac{\delta^2 y}{\delta x^2}=cy\)

\(y=Ae^{\sqrt c (y+a)}\)
