\subsection{Linear second-order Ordinary Differential Equations}

These are of the form

\(\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+p(t)\frac{dy}{dt}+q(t)y=g(t)\)

There are two types. Homogenous equations are where \(g(t)=0\). Otherwise they are heterogenous.

We explore the case with constants:

\(a\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+b\frac{dy}{dt}+cy=0\)
