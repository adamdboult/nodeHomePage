\subsection{Separable first-order Ordinary Differential Equations}

For some we can write:

\(\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t,y)\)

\(\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{g(t)}{h(y)}\)

We can then do the following:

\(h(y)\frac{dy}{dt}=g(t)\)

\(\int h(y)\frac{dy}{dt}dt=\int g(t)dt + C\)

\(\int h(y)dy=\int g(t)dt + C\)

In some cases, these functions can then be integrated and solved.
