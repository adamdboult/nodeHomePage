\subsection{Products}


A product is a repeated multiplication of a sequence.

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^ns_i\)

\subsubsection{Multiplication of products}

We can take constants out of the product.

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^nca_i\)

\(p_n=a^{n}\sum_{i=0}^na_i\)

\subsubsection{Products of constants}

If \(a_i=c\) then the summation is then of the form:

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^nc\)

\(p_n=c^{n}\prod_{i=j}^n1\)

\(p_n=c^{n}\)

\subsubsection{Combining products}

If a sequence is the product of to other sequences then the product of the sequence is equal to the product of the two individual sequences.

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^na_i\)

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^nb_ic_i\)

\(p_n=\prod_{i=0}^nb_i\prod_{i=0}^nc_i\)
