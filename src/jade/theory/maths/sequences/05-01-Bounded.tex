\subsection{Bounded sequences}

A function \(f(x)\) on set \(X\) is bounded if:

\(\exists M\in \mathbb{R} [\forall x\in X f(x)\le M]\)

A bounded sequence is a special case of a bounded function where:

\(X=\mathbb{N}\)

That is, a sequence is bounded by \(M\) iff:

\(\forall n\in \mathbb{R} |f(a_n)|\le M\)
