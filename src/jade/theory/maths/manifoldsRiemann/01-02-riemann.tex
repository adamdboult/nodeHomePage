\subsection{Riemann manifolds and pseudo-Riemann manifolds}

\subsubsection{Riemann manifolds}

Metric is positive definite.

\subsubsection{Pseudo-Riemann manifolds}

The metric isn't necessarily positive definite.


\subsection{Metric tensor field}

metric tensor field assigns a metric tensor to each point. metric tensor is defined on the tangent bundle.
so we have metric on each tangent bundle, but the metric can change thoughout the manifold
