\subsection{Intervals}

For a totally ordered set we can define a subset as being all elements with a relationship to a number. For example:

$[a,b]=\{x:a\le x \land x\le b\}$

This denotes a closed interval. Using the definition above we can also define an open interval:

$(a,b)=\{x:a< x \land x< b\}$
