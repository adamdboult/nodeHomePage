\subsection{Ordered sets}

\subsubsection{Totally ordered sets}

A totally ordered set is one where the relation is defined on all pairs:

$\forall a \forall b	(a\le b)\lor (b\le a)$

Note that totality implies reflexivity.

\subsubsection{Partially ordered sets (poset)}

A partially ordered set, or poset, is one where the relation is defined between each element and itself.

$\forall a (a\le a)$

That is, every element is related to itself.

These are also called posets.

\subsubsection{Well-ordering}

A well-ordering on a set is a total order on the set where the set contains a minimum number. For example the relation \(\le \) on the natural numbers is a well-ordering because \(0\) is the minimum.

The relation \(\le \) on the integers however is not a well-ordering, as there is no minimum number in the set.
