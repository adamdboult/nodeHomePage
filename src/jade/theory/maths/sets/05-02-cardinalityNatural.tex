\subsection{Cardinality of the natural numbers}

Consider the infinite set, that is the set of all natural numbers which is defined in ZFC. Clearly there isn’t a natural number cardinality of this – we instead write \(\aleph_0\).

We call sets with this cardinality, countably infinite.

So:

\(|\mathbb{N} |=\aleph_0\)

\subsubsection{Cardinality of natural  numbers}

We define:

\(|\emptyset |=0\)

That, the empty set has a cardinality of \(0\).

As we define \(0\) as the empty set, \(|0|=0\).

What is \(1\)? using the definition above we know \(|1|>|0|\), so let's say \(|1|=1\), and more generally:

\(\forall n \in \mathbb{N} |n|=n\)
