\subsection{Implications of axiom schema of specification}

\subsubsection{All finite subsets exist}

Finite subsets. Don't know about infinite subsets

If we can define a subset, by the axiom of specification it exists.

For example if set \(\{a,b,c\}\) exists, we can define a preterite to select any subset of this.

For example we can use define a \(P(x)\) as \(x=a\lor x=b\) to extract the subset \(\{a,b\}\).

If a subset is infinitely large, 

\subsubsection{Intersections of finite sets exist}

Can prove exists from this axiom

\subsubsection{If any set exists, the empty set exists}

\(\forall x \forall a \exists s[(P(x)\land x\in a )\leftrightarrow (x\in s)]\)
