\subsection{Finite and infinite sets}


\subsubsection{Finite sets}

A set is finite is there is a proper subset without a bijection.

Proper subset: \(A\subset B\)

For example for set \(\{a,b,c\}\) There is no subset with a bijection.

\subsubsection{Infinite sets}

For the natural numbers, all natural numbers except 0 is a proper subset, and there is a bijection.
