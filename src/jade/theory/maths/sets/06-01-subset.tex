\subsection{Subset relation}

\subsubsection{Subset}

If all terms which are members of term \(x\) are also members of term \(y\), then \(x\) is a subset of \(y\).

$\forall x\forall y[(\forall z(z\in x\rightarrow z\in y))\leftrightarrow (x\subseteq y)]$

\subsubsection{Proper subset}

If two sets are equal, then each is a subset of the other. A proper subset is one which is a subset, and not equal to the other set.

$\forall x\forall y[((\forall z(z\in x\rightarrow z\in y)))\land(x\ne y)\leftrightarrow (x\subset y)]$
