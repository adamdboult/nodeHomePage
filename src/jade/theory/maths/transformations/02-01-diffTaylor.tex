\subsection{Taylor series}


\(f(x)\) can be estimated at point \(c\) by identifying its repeated differentials at point \(c\).

The coefficients of an infinate number of polynomials at point \(c\) allow this.

$f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty }a_i(x-c)^i$

$f'(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty }a_i(x-c)^{i-1}i$

$f''(x)=\sum_{i=2}^{\infty }a_i(x-c)^{i-2}i(i-1)$

$f^j(x)=\sum_{i=j}^{\infty }a_i(x-c)^{i-j}\frac{i!}{(i-j)!}$

For \(x=c\) only the first term in the series is non-zero.

$f^j(c)=\sum_{i=j}^{\infty }a_i(c-c)^{i-j}\frac{i!}{(i-j)!}$

$f^j(c)=a_ij!$

So:

$a_j=\frac{f^j(c)}{j!}$

So:

$f(x)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty (x-c)^i \frac{f^i(c)}{i!}$
