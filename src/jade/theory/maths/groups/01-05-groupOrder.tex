\subsection{Group order}

For finite groups, each element \(e\) has:

\(e^n=I\)

For some \(n\in \mathbb{N}\)

Where \(I\) is the identity element.

The order of the group is the smallest value of \(n\) such that that holds for all elements.

For example in the multiplicative group \(G=\{-1,1\}\) the order is \(2\).

Or:

\(|G|=2\)

Additionally

\(|-1|=2\)

\(|1|=1\)
