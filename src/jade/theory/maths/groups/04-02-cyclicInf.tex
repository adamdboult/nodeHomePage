\subsubsection{The additive group of integers}

\subsubsection{Generating cyclic groups}

We can generate a group with a single element, it is a cyclic group.

For example, we can define a group \(G=<1>\) which gives us the additive group of integers.

\subsubsection{Infinite cyclic groups are isomorphic to the additive group of integers}

More generally, any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of integers.

Consider the multiplicative group of \(< i >\).

This contains \(\{1,-1,i,-i \} \).

This is also automorphic to the natural number and modulo addition group above.

We can define finite cyclic groups of size \(n\) using the generating element \(z^{\frac{1}{n}}\). This is isomorphic to the general cyclic group \(C_n\), and to \(Z/nZ\).

\subsubsection{Abelian cyclic groups}

Cyclic groups are abelian.
