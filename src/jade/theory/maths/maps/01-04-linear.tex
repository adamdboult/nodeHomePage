\subsection{Linear and affine functions}

\subsubsection{Linear maps}

Linear maps can be written as:

\(v=Mu\)

These go through the origin. That is, if \(u=0\) then \(v=0\).

\subsubsection{Affine function}

Affine functions are more general than linear maps. They can be written as:

\(v=Mu+c\)

Where \(c\) is a vector in the same space as \(v\).

Affine functions where \(c\ne 0\) are not linear maps. They are not homomorphisms which preserve the structure of the vector space.

If we multiply \(u\) by a scalar \(s\), then \(v\) will not increase by the same proportion.
