\subsection{Linear maps}

\subsubsection{Homomorphisms between vector spaces}

Homomorphisms map between algebras, preserving the underlying structure.

A homomorphism vetween vector space \(V\) and vector space \(W\) can be described as:

\(\hom (V, W)\)

Homomorphism between vector spaces must preserve the group-like structure of the vector space.

\(f(u+v)=f(u)+f(v)\)

The homomorphism must also preserve scalar multiplication.

\(f(\alpha v)=\alpha f(v)\)

A linear map (or function) is a map from one input to an output which preserves addition and scalar multiplication.

That is if function \(f\) is linear then:

\(f(aM+bN)=af(M)+bf(N)\)

\subsubsection{Alternative names for homomorphisms}

Vector spaces homomorphisms are also called linear maps or linear functions.
