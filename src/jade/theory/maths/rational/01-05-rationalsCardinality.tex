\subsection{Cardinality of the rationals}

\subsubsection{Cardinality of rational numbers}

We can see rational numbers as cartesian products of integers. That is:

\(\mathbb{Q}=Z.Z\)

We can order the rational numbers like so:

\(\{\dfrac{1}{1},\dfrac{2}{1},\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{1}{3},\dfrac{2}{2}\dfrac{3}{1}...\}\)

These can be mapped from natural numbers, so there is a bijunctive function.

So:

\(|\mathbb{Q} |=|\mathbb{Z}.\mathbb{Z} |=|\mathbb{N} |=\aleph_0\)

As: \(|\mathbb{Z}.\mathbb{Z} |=|\mathbb{Z}|^2\)

\(|\mathbb{N}|^n=\mathbb{N}\)
