\subsection{Vector spaces}

A vector space is a group with additional structure.

The operation for each element is shown as addition. So we can say:

\(\forall u,v \in V [u+v \in V]\)

To this we add scalars, from a field \(F\). We write this as multiplication.

\(\forall f \in F \forall v \in V [fv \in V]\)

\subsubsection{Subspace}

A subspace is a subset of \(V\) which still acts as a vector space. In practice, this means fewer dimensions.
