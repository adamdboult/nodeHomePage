\subsection{Basis vectors}

\subsubsection{Basis}

We can write vectors as combinations of other vectors.

\(v=\sum_i \alpha_i v_i\)

A subset which spans the vector space, and which is also linearly independent, is a basis of the vector space.

For an arbitrary vector of size \(n\), we cannot use less than \(n\) elementary vectors. We could use more, but these would be redundant.

If we use \(n\) elementary vectors, there is a unique solution of weights of elementary vectors.

If we use more than \(n\) elementary vectors, there will be linear dependence, and so there will not be a unique solution.
