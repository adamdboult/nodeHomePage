\subsection{Reals or rationals for analysis}

Why can't we use rationals for analysis?

If discontinous at not rational number, it can still be continous for all rationals.

eg f(x)=-1 unless x^2>2, where f(x)=1

Continous for all rationals, because rationals dense in reals

But can't be differentiated
