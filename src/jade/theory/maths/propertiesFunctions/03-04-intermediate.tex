\subsection{Intermediate value theorem}

Take a real function \(f(x)\) on closed interval \([a,b]\), continuous on \([a,b,]\).

IVT says that for all numbers \(u\) between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\), there is a corresponding value \(c\) in \([a,b]\) such that \(f(c)=u\).

That is:

\(\forall u \in [min(f(a),f(b)),max(f(a),f(b))] \exists c \in [a,b] (f(c)=u)\)
