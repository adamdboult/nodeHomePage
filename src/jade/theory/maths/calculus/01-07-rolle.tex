\subsubsection{Rolle’s theorem}

Take a real function \(f(x)\) on closed interval \([a,b]\), differentiable on \((a,b,)\), and \(f(a)=f(b)\).

Rolle’s theorem states that:

$\exists c\in(a,b) (f’(c)=0)$

Generalised Rolle’s theorem states that:

Generalised Rolle’s theorem implies Rolle’s theorem, so we only need to prove the generalised theorem.
