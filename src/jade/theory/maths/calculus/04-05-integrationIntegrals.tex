\subsubsection{Methods of integration}

Trigonometric substitution

Inverse function integration function integration

Anti-derivative

Taking the derivative of a function provides another function. The anti-derivative of a function is a function which, when differentiated, provides the original function.

As this function can include any additive constant, there are an infinite number of anti-derivatives for any function.

Integration

Limit of summation

Show same as anti-derivative

Show properties of function same as summation (can take constants out etc)

\subsubsection{Getting functions from derivatives}

$f(c)=f(a)+\int^c_a \dfrac{\delta }{\delta x}f(x) dx$

Definite integration

Indefinite integration
