\subsection{Examples of linear operators on real functions}

For a function \(v\) we can define operators \(Ov\).

Here we consider some examples and their properties.

\subsubsection{Real multiplication}

\(Rv = rf(x)\)

This operator is hermitian. This is equivalent to a finite operator of the form \(rI\).

\subsubsection{Multiplication by underlying real number}

\(Xv = xf(x)\)

This operator is hermitian. This is equivalent to a finite operator of the form \(M_{ii}=i\) and \(M_{ij}=0\).

\subsubsection{Differentiation}

\(Dv = \dfrac{\delta }{\delta x}f(x)\)

While this operator is not hermitian, the following is:

\(-iDv = \dfrac{\delta }{\delta x}[-if(x)]\)
