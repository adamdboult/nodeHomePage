\subsection{Functions between topologies}

We can define a function from topology to another.

\(f(X)=Y\)

\subsubsection{Continuous functions between topologies}

If \(f(X)\) is continous, then we have a continous function between topologies.

\subsubsection{Inverse functions between topologies}

If \(f(X)\) is invertible then there is a inverse mapping.
