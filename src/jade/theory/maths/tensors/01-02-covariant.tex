\subsection{Covariant and contravariant bases}

In element form we write a vector as:

\(v=e_iv^i\)

The indices are raised and lowered to reflect whether the value is covariant or contravariant.

\(v^i\) is contravariant. If the basis moves one way, it moves the other.

\(e_i\) is covariant. If the basis moves, it moves with it.
