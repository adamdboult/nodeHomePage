\subsection{Higher-order tensors}

We can create higher order tensors products. For example

\(V\otimes V \otimes V\otimes V^* \otimes V^*\)

We write elements of these as:

\(T_{j_1,...,j_q}^{i_1,...,i_p}\)

We can map from matrix to matrix etc higher dimensional

Matrix has A: a_{ij}

Tensor can have T: t_{ijk} for example

0 rank tensor: scalar

1 rank tensor: vector

2 rank tensor: matrix
