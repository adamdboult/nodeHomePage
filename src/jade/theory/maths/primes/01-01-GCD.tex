\subsection{Divisors and Greatest Common Divisors (GCD)}

\subsubsection{Divisors}

The divisors \(d\) of a natural number \(n\) are the natural numbers such that \(\dfrac{n}{d}\in \mathbb{N}\).

For example, for \(6\) the divisors are \(1, 2, 3, 6\).

Divisors cannot be bigger than the number they are dividing.

\subsubsection{Universal divisors}

For any number \(n \in \mathbb{N}^+\):

\(\dfrac{n}{n}=1\)

\(\dfrac{n}{1}=n\)

Both \(1\) and \(n\) are divisors.

\subsubsection{Common divisors}

A common divisor is a number which is a divisor to two supplied numbers.

\subsubsection{Greatest common divisor}

The greatest common divisor of \(2\) numbers is as the name suggests.

So \(GCD(18,24)=6\)
