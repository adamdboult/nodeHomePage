\subsection{Euclidian division}

Euclidian division is the theory for any pair of natural numbers, we can divide one by the other and have a remainder less than the divisor. Formally:
\(\forall a \in \mathbb{N} ,\forall b \in \mathbb{N}^+ ,\exists q \in \mathbb{N},\exists r\in \mathbb{N} [(a=bq+r)\land (0\le r < b)]\)

Where \(\mathbb{N}^+\) refers to natural numbers excluding \(0\).

That is, every natural number \(a\) is a multiple \(q\) of any other natural number \(b\), plus another natural number \(r\) less than the other natural number \(b\).

These are unique. For each jump in \(q\), \(r\) falls by \(b\). As the range of \(r\) is \(b\) there is only one solution.

\(17=2.8+1\)

\(9=3.3+0\)
