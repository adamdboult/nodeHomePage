\subsection{Special orthogonal groups \(SO(n, F)\)}

The special orthogonal group, \(SO(n,F)\), is the subgroup of the orthogonal group where \(|M|=1\).

As a result it includes only the rotation operators, not the flip operators.

\(SO(3)\) is rotations in 3d space.

\(SO(2)\) is rotations in 2d space.

\subsubsection{Determinant of the orthogonal group}

The orthogonal group has determinants of \(-1\) or \(1\).

\(O^T=O^{-1}\)

\(\det (O^T)=\det (O^{-1})\)

\(\det O=\dfrac{1}{\det O}\)

\(\det O=\pm 1\)
