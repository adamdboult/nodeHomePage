\subsection{Linear forms}

A linear form is a linear map from a vector space to a scalar from the vector space's underlying field.

\(\hom (V, F)\)

\subsubsection{Matrix operators}

Linear forms can be represented as matrix operators.

\(v^TM=f\)

Where \(M\) has only one column.

\subsubsection{Stuff}

$f(M)=f(v)$

We introduce \(e_i\), the element vector. This is \(0\) for all entries except for \(i\) where it is \(1\). Any vector can be shown as a sum of these vectors multiplied by a scalar.

$f(M)=f(\sum^m_{i=1}a_{i}e_i)$

$f(M)=\sum_{i=1}^mf(a_{i}e_i)$

$f(M)=\sum_{i=1}^ma_if(e_i)$

$f(M)=\sum_{i=1}^ma_if(e_i)$

\subsubsection{Orthonormal basis}

$f(M)=\sum_{i=1}^ma_i$
