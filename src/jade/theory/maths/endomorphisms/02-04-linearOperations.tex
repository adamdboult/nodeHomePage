\subsection{Matrix additon and multiplication}

\subsubsection{Matrix multiplication}

$A=A^{mn}$

$B=B^{no}$

$C=C^{mo}=A.B$

$c_{ij}=\sum_{r=1}^na_{ir}b_{rj}$

Matrix multiplication depends on the order. Unlike for real numbers, 

$AB\ne BA$

Matrix multiplication is not defined unless the condition above on dimensions is met.

A matrix multiplied by the identity matrix returns the original matrix.

For matrix \(M=M^{mn}\)

$M=MI^m=I^nM$

\subsubsection{Matrix addition}

\(2\) matricies of the same size, that is with idental dimensions, can be added together.

If we have \(2\) matrices \(A^{mn}\) and \(B^{mn}\)

$C=A+B$

$c_{ij}=a_{ij}+b_{ij}$

An empty matrix with \(0\)s of the same size as the other matrix is the identity matrix for addition.

\subsubsection{Scalar multiplication}

A matrix can be multiplied by a scalar. Every element in the matrix is multiplied by this.

$B=cA$

$b_{ij}=ca_{ij}$

The scalar \(1\) is the identity scalar.
