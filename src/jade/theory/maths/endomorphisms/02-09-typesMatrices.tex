\subsection{Types of matrices}
\subsubsection{Empty matrix}

A matrix where every element is \(0\). There is one for each dimension of matrix.

\(A=\begin{bmatrix}0& 0&...&0\\0 & 0&...&0\\...&...&...&...\\0&0&...&0\end{bmatrix}\)

\subsection{Triangular matrix}

A matrix where \(a_{ij}=0\) where \(i < j\) is upper triangular.

A matrix where \(a_{ij}=0\) where \(i > j\) is lower triangular.

A matrix which is either upper or lower triangular is a triangular matrix.

\subsection{Symmetric matrices}

All symmetric matrices are square.

The identity matrix is an example.

A matrix where \(a_{ij}=a_{ji}\) is symmetric.

\subsection{Diagonal matrix}

A matrix where \(a_ij=0\) where \(i\ne j\) is diagonal.

All diagonal matrices are symmetric.

The identity matrix is an example.
