\subsubsection{\(U(n)\) forms a Lie group}

\subsubsection{Lie algebra of \(U(n)\)}

The Lie algebra of \(U(n)\) is defined as:

\(\mathfrak{u}(n)=\{X\in \mathbb {C}^{n\times n}|e^{tX}\in U(n) \forall t\in \mathbb{R}\}\)

This is satisfied by the skew-Hermitian matrices where \(M=-M^*\). Note that this means the diagonals are all \(0\) or pure imaginary.
