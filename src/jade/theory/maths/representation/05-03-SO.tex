\subsection{Lie algebra of \(SO(n)\)}

\subsubsection{\(SO(n)\) forms a Lie group}

\subsubsection{Lie algebra of \(SO(n)\)}

The Lie algebra of \U(n)\) is defined as:

\(\mathfrak{so}(n)=\{X\in \mathbb {R}^{n\times n}|e^{tX}\in SO(n) \forall t\in \mathbb{R}\}\)

This is satisfied by the skew-symmetric matrices where \(M=-M^T\). Note that this means the diagonals are all \(0\).
