\subsection{Introduction}

\(m_{11}x+m_{12}y+m_{13}z=v_1\)

\(m_{21}x+m_{22}y+m_{23}z=v_2\)

\(m_{31}x+m_{32}y+m_{33}z=v_3\)


\subsection{Matrix and vector notation}

We can write the above as:

\(\mathbf{M}x=\mathbf{v}\)

What are the properties of \(\mathbf{M}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\)?

They are linear and addition and scalar multiplication.
