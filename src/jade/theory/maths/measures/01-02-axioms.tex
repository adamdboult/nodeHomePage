\subsection{Axioms for measures}


\subsubsection{Measures are non-negative}

$\forall E \in \Sigma : \mu (E)\ge 0$

\subsubsection{The measure for the null set is \(0\).}

$\mu (\null )=0$

\subsubsection{Disjoint sets are additive}

$\mu (\lor_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k)=\sum \mu (E_k)$

Where all elements \(E_k\) are disjoint. That is, they have no elements in common.
