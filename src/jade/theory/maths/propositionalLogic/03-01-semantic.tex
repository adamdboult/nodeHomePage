\subsection{Semantic consequence}

A formula, \(A\), semantically implies another, \(B\), if for every interpretation of \(A\), \(B\) is true.

We show this with:

$A\vDash B$

Formula \(B\) is satisfisable if there is some \(A\) where this is true.

For example:
$A\land B \vDash A$

Formula \(B\) is a tautology if this is true for any \(A\). We can also write this as \(\vDash B\).

\subsection{Logical equivalence}

If \(A\vDash B\) and \(B\vDash A\) we say that \(A\) and \(B\) are logically equivalent.

This is shown as \(A \Leftrightarrow B\).
