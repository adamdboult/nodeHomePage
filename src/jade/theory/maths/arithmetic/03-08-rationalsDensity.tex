\subsection{Density of the rationals}

\subsubsection{Rationals are dense in rationals}

For any pair of rationals, there is another rational between them:

\(a=\frac{p}{q}\)

\(b=\frac{m}{n}\)

Where \(b>a\).

We define a new rational:

\(c=\frac{a+b}{2}\)

\(c=\frac{pn+qm}{2qn}\)

This is a rational number.

We can write:

\(a=\frac{2pn}{2qn}\)

\(b=\frac{2qm}{2qn}\)

As \(b>a\) we know \(2qm>2pn\)

So: \(a < c < b\)
