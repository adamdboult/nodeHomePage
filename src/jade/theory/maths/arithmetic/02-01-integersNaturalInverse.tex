\subsection{Division}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

We have inverse functions for multiplication. This is division.

These will not necessarily have solutions for natural numbers or integers. 

\subsubsection{Division of natural numbers}

\(a.b=c\rightarrow b=\dfrac{c}{a}\)
	
\subsubsection{Division is not commutative}

Division is not commutative:

\(\dfrac{x}{y}\ne \dfrac{y}{x}\)

\subsubsection{Division is not associative}

\(\dfrac{x}{\dfrac{y}{z}}\ne \dfrac{\dfrac{x}{y}}{z}\)

\subsubsection{Division is not left distributive}

Division is not left distributive over subtraction:

\(\dfrac{a}{b-c} \ne \dfrac{a}{b} -\dfrac{a}{c}\)

\subsubsection{Division is right distributive}

Division is right distributive over subtraction:

\(\dfrac{a-b}{c} =\dfrac{a}{b} -\dfrac{b}{c}\)
	


\subsubsection{Division of integers}
