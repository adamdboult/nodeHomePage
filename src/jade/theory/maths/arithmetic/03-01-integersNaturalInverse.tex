\subsection{Division}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

We have inverse functions for multiplication. This is division.

These will not necessarily have solutions for natural numbers or integers. 

\subsubsection{Division of natural numbers}

$a.b=c\rightarrow b=\frac{c}{a}$
	
\subsubsection{Division is not commutative}

Division is not commutative:

$\frac{x}{y}\ne \frac{y}{x}$

\subsubsection{Division is not associative}

$\frac{x}{\frac{y}{z}}\ne \frac{\frac{x}{y}}{z}$

\subsubsection{Division is not left distributive}

Division is not left distributive over subtraction:

$\frac{a}{b-c} \ne \frac{a}{b} -\frac{a}{c}$

\subsubsection{Division is right distributive}

Division is right distributive over subtraction:

$\frac{a-b}{c} =\frac{a}{b} -\frac{b}{c}$
	


\subsubsection{Division of integers
