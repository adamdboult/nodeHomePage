\subsection{Prime numbers and composite numbers}

\subsubsection{Definition}

A prime number is a number which does not have any divisors other than \(1\) and itself.

By convention we do not refer to \(0\) or \(1\) as prime numbers.

\subsubsection{Identifying prime numbers}

Divisors must be smaller than the number. As a result it is easy to identify early prime numbers, as we can try to divide by all preceding numbers.

\subsubsection{Examples of prime numbers}

\([2, 3 5, 7, 11, 13,...]\)

\subsubsection{Composite numbers}

Composite numbers are numbers that are  made up through the multiplication of other numbers.

They are not prime.
