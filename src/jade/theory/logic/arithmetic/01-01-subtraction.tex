\subsection{Subtraction of natural numbers}

We have inverse functions for addition. This is subtraction.

For function \(\oplus\), its inverse is \(\oplus' \), as defined below:

$a\oplus b=c$

$b=c\oplus 'a$

$f(a,b)=c\rightarrow f^{-1}(c,b)=a$

\subsubsection{Subtraction}

$a+b=c\rightarrow b=c-a$

There is no natural number \(b\) that satisfies:

$3+b=2$

While addition and multiplication are defined across all natural numbers, subtraction is not.
\subsubsection{Properties of subtraction}

Subtraction is not commutative:

$x-y\ne y-x$

Subtraction is not associative:

$x-(y-z)\ne (x-y)-z$
