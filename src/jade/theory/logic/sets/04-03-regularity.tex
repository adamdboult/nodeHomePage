\subsection{Axiom of regularity}

The axiom of regularity states that:

\(\forall x[x\ne \varnothing \rightarrow \exists y \in x (y\land x )=\varnothing]\)

That is, for all non-empty sets, there is an element of the set which is disjoint from the set itself.

This means that no set can be a member of itself.
