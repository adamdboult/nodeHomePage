\subsection{Completeness of zero-order logic}

A theory is complete if all true formulae are included.

Note that there are three types of formulae in a theory.

\begin{itemize}
\item Tautologies (always true)
\item Refutable formulae (always false)
\item Satisfiable formulae which are not tautologies (true in some, but not all, interpretations).
\end{itemize}
