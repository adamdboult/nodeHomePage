\subsection{Power law}

\(P(X)=\dfrac{\alpha -1}{a}(\dfrac{x}{a})^{-\alpha }\)

Where \(a\) is the lower bound.

\(P(X)=0\) for \(X<a\).

\subsubsection{Moments of the power law}

\(E[X^m]=\dfrac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha -1 -m }a\)

If \(m\ge \alpha -1 \) then this is not well defined.

Higher order moments, such that the variance, cannot be identified.
