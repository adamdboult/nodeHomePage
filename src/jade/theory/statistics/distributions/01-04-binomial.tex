\subsection{Binomial distribution}

If we repeat a Bernoulli trials with the same parameter and sum the results, we have the binomial distribution.

We therefore have two parameters, \(p\) and \(n\).

\(P(X=x)={n\choose x }p^x(1-p)^{n-x}\)

\subsubsection{Moments of the binomial distribution}

The mean is \(np\), which can be seen as the trials are independent.

Similarly, the variances can be addeded together giving \(np(1-p)\).
