\subsection{Cram√©r-Rao lower bound}

For an unbiased estimator, the variance cannot be below the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

\(Var (\hat \theta )\ge \frac{1}{I(\theta )}\)

Where \(I(\theta )\) is the Fisher information.

We can prove this.

We have the score:

\(V=\frac{\delta }{\delta \theta }\ln f(X, \theta )\)

\(V=\frac{1}{f(X, \theta )}\frac{\delta }{\delta \theta } f(X, \theta )\)

The expectation of the score is \(0\):

\(E[V]=E[\frac{1}{f(X, \theta )}\frac{\delta }{\delta \theta } f(X, \theta )]\)

\(E[V]=\int \frac{1}{f(X, \theta )}\frac{\delta }{\delta \theta } f(X, \theta )dx\)
