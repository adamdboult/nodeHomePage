\subsection{Estimators}

When we take statistics we are often concerned with inferring properties of the underlying probability function.

As the properties of the probability distribution function affect the chance of observing the sample, we can analyse samples to infer properties of the underlying distribution.

There are many properties would could be interested in. This includes moments and parameters of a specific probability distribution function.

An estimator is a statistic which is our estimate of one of these values.

Emphasise that statistics and estimators are different things. A statistic may be terrible estimator, but be useful for other purposes.
