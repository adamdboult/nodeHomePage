\subsection{Testing estimators}

Assessing estimators of parametric models: do monte carlo simulations


\subsection{Loss}

loss functions for point estimates.
point estimate confidence interval h3

\subsection{Estimator properties}

best asymptotically normal (BAN) estimators
AKA consistently asymptotically normal efficience (CANE)

these are root n consistent!

\subsection{Feasible and infeasible estimators}

Feasible uses known terms. Infeasible uses those that aren't

Eg \(\Omega \) is infeasible, unless we assume its form, making it feasible.

\subsection{Bias etc}

pages:
+ Cramer rao
+ Minimum-Variance Unbiased Estimators (MVUE)

Unbiased estimators for some kernel value. Can use used to estimate population moments.

\subsection{Rao-Blackwell theorem}

\subsection{One step and k-step estimators}
in cramer rao stuff?
\subsection{Delta method}
in bias section?

We can consider \(X_n\) to be a sequence. We are interest in asymptotic properties of this sequence.

\subsection{Fat tails}

section on fat tails
+ can't estimate pop mean from sample mean
+ method of moments requires non-fat tails
+ correlation/covariance with fat tails.
