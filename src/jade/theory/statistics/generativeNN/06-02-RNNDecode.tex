\subsection{Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) decoders}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

We take the encoded vector and pass this through to the decoder. This spits out decoded output.

As we output a word, the word (and previous words) are sent as inputs to the following RNN cells.

\subsubsection{Encoding the outputs}

As we create outputs, we can pass this as an encoded vector in the target language.
