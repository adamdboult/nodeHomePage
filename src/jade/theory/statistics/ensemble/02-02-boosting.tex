\subsubsection{Introduction}

Boosting is a way to create multiple learners for use in an ensemble predictor.

The goal is to create many predictors, which may not be themselves very accuracte, but have a high degree of independence.

\subsubsection{AdaBoost}

AdaBoost is a popular algorithm for boosting.

It works by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Creating a set of weak learners using different restrictions on features in the training data.
\item Choosing the weak learner that most reduces the error of the combined learners, and give it a weighting which most reduces the error of the combined learners.
\item Creating a new weighting for the dataset, where ones poorly predicted (by the combination of learners) are given high weights.
\item Repeating the process a fixed number of times.
\end{itemize}
