\subsection{Gradient boosting}

Gradient boosting does not iterative change the weights for the learners. Instead, it trains on different errors.

While AdaBoost trains to reduce the absolute error for each weak classifier, gradient boosting trains on the difference between the actual classiffication and the current classification.
