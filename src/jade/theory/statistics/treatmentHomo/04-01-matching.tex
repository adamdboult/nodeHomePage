\subsection{Matching}

Matching is similar to regression. We assume that effects are constant, and the effect of treatment on \(y_{0i}\) and \(y_{1i}\) are independent of treatment, once controlling for \(X\).

Again, this is biased if this is not the case.

We however do not have to assume a linear form for \(X\).

We assume: \(E[y_{ji}|\mathbf x_{i}, D_i]=E[y_{ji}|\mathbf x_{i}]\)

For each entity, find a near entity which had the opposite treatment.
