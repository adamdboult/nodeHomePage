\subsection{Regression}

We can simply regress outcomes on variables, including treatment.

This assumes treatment effects are constant.

This also assumes that outcomes \(y_{1i}\) and \(y_{0i}\) are independent of \(D_i\), conditional on \(X\).

If we are missing variables in \(X\) then we will have biased estimates.

This also assumes the effects of \(X\) are linear.

We assume: \(E[y_{0i}|\mathbf x_{i}, D_i]=\mathbf x_i \theta\).
