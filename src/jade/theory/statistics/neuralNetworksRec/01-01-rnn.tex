\subsection{Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are an alternative to feedforward networks.

These have loops.

\subsubsection{Motivation}

We have inputs which are not independent. For example speech input, where each input is a the recording for a length of time.

\subsubsection{Unrolling RNNs}

The activation unit takes the input, and an outcome from the previous activation unit. It then performs its activation function.

This allows information to be kept across time.

However this degrades, and relevant information was from much earlier, it will be lost.
