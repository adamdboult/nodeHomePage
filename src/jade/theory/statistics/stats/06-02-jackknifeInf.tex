\subsection{The infintesimal jackknife}

\subsubsection{The jackknife as a weighting}

In the jackknife we calculate the statistic leaving one observation out.

This is the same as weighting observations and giving one a weighting of \(0\) and the others \(1\).

\subsubsection{The infintesimal jackknife}

For the infintesimal jackknife we reduce the weight not to \(0\), but by an infintesimal amount.
