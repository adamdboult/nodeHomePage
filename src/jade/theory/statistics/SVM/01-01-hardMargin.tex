\subsection{Hard-margin SVC}

\subsubsection{Linear separators}

We want to create a hyperplane to separate classes.

For classification problem (x, y)

Hyperplane is wx-b=0

\subsubsection{Hard margin}

If data is linearly separable then a hyperplane exists such that all data can be correctly classified

There are an infinit number that could work.

We select two parallel with distance between as large as possible. the region between these two is the margin

The maximum margin hyperplane is the one between the two margin planes

We can rescale the two hyperplanes to:

wx-b=1

wx-b=-1

The distance between the two parrallel hyperplanes is \(\frac{2}{||w||}\)

So we minimise \(||w||\) conditional an all points being correctly classified

\(y_i(wx_i-b)\ge 1\)

We select w and b to solve this.
