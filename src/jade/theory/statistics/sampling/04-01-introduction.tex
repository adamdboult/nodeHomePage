\subsection{Introduction}

Used to sample from propability distribution function.

Useful when can't use direct sampling, because no closed form.

MORE GENERALLY FRAME THESE FIRST AS SAMPLING FROM PROBABILITY FUNCTION.

Generate pairs of \((x, y)\). If \(y<P(x)\) then keep \(x\).


Metropolis-Hastings and Gibb's sampling are extensions of this.
