\subsection{Convergence in probability and o-notation}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Converges in probability

+ P(distance(X_n, X)>\epsilon )\rightarrow 0

For all \(\epsilon \).

\(X_n \rightarrow^P X\)

\subsubsection{Little o notation}

Little o notation is used to describe convergence in probability.

\(X_n=o_p(a_n)\)

mean that

\(\frac{X_n}{a_n}\)

Converges to \(0\) and \(n\) approaches something

Can be wrtiten:

\(\frac{X_n}{a_n}=o_p(1)\)

\subsubsection{Big O notation}

Big O notation is used to describe boundedness.

\(X_n=O_p(a_n)\)

means that:

If something is little o, it is big O.
