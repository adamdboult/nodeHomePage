\subsection{Difference-in-difference}

Consider the grouped linear model: 

\(y_{ij}=\mu+\tau_i+X_{j}\theta +\epsilon_{ij}\)

By taking differences with another observation in the same group we remove the average terms.

\(y_{ij}-y_{ik}=(\mu+\tau_i+X_{j}\theta +\epsilon_{ij})- (\mu + \tau_i + X_{k}\theta + \epsilon_{ik})\)

\(y_{ij}-y_{ik}=(X_{j}\theta - X_{k})+(\epsilon_{ij}- \epsilon_{ik})\)



diff in diff: control group and treated group. page on leakiness? are control affected too? Assumption: in absense of treatment, price would have evolved like control
