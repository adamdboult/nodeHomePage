\subsection{Modelling non-linear functions as linear}

\subsubsection{Polynomials}

The function \(y=x^2\) is not linear, however we can model is as linear, by including \(x^2\) as a variable.

We can expand this, and using linear models to estimate parameters for functions such as:

\(y=ax^3+bx^2+xz\)

\subsubsection{Logarithms and exponentials}

We can also transform data using logarithms and exponents.

For example we can model

\(\ln y=\theta \ln x\)
