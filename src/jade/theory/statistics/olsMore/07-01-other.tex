synthetic IV indep on nuisance as alternative to matching.

IV: h3 on non-linear models for first stage

discontinuity

controlled experiments

two sources: missing data and simultaneous

variations in government rollouts, lotteries

IV may only affect subset of individuals

For example IV of draft number for military service. This only is an instrument for conscripts, not volunteers

generally, need to rationalise this and time series. There's stuff there on natural experiments etc

define confounding in IV? or in dependent variables?
is different issue to the one of correlation with error?

h3 on Limited Information Maximum Likelihood

h3 on K-class estimation

Contrast loss and Siamese h3? One shot classification

IV: frame around parameter estimation when don't observe some variables. This can mean the direct variable can't be measured, or that some controls can't be measured

which factors to include? All?

page on structural and reduced forms

h3 on simultaneous equations there?
Eg
\(y=c_1+\theta_1 X+\epsilon_1\)
\(y=c_2+\theta_2 X+\rho Z\epsilon_2\)

We can turn this into the reduced form:
\(y=c_3+\theta_3Z+\epsilon_3\)
\(y=c_4+\theta_4Z+\epsilon_4\)

difference between confounding and correlation with error?
