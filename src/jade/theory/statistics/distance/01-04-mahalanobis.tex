\subsection{Mahalanobis distance}

We have a point. How far away is this from the mean.

For a single dimension: number of standard deviations.

What about multidimensional data?

Could do sd for all distances, but correlations between variables. If two variables are highly correlated, it's not really twice as far.

We use this:

\(D_M(\mathbf x\)=\sqrt {(\mathbf x-\mathbf \mu )^TS^{-1}(\mathbf x-\mathbf \mu )}\)
