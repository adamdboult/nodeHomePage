\subsection{The recommendation problem}

We have a collection of users and a collection of products. We want to recommend products to customers.

Once a customer "consumes" something, we get feedback. however for vast majority of items, not consumed. goal: predict feedback score beforehand to make good recommendations.

We have a matrix of how much each customer "likes" things. however this is v sparce.
