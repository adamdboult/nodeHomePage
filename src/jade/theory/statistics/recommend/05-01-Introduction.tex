\subsection{Missing data}


In missing data: missing data mechanism page, missing at random page. Prediction with missing data; inference with missing data. Should be relatively late page

Missing time series data (ARIMA interpolation?) Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF); Next Observation Carried Backward (NOCB), linear interpolation,

Deleting whole row if missing data (bias if not random)

Interpolation: mean, conditional (in IID, different for time series)

Create multiple imputations, do analysis, then combine results

Multiple imputation

Multi period averages for imputation on time series

Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), different to MAR
