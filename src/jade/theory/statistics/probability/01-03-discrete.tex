\subsection{Discrete and continous probability}

We know that:

$\sum_yP(X\land Y)=P(X)$

So for the continuous case

$P(X)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty }P(X\land Y)dy$

This behaves like the probability for a single event, or multiple events with one fewer event if there were more than \(2\) events to start with.
