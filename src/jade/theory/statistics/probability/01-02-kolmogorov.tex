\subsection{Kolmogorov axioms}

\subsubsection{First axiom}

The probability of all events is a non-negative real number.

$\forall E \in F [(P(E)\ge 0)\land (P(E)\in \mathbb{R})]$

\subsubsection{Second axiom}

The probability of one of the elementary events occuring is \(1\).

The probability of the outcome set is \(1\).

$P(\Omega )=1$

\subsubsection{Third axiom}

The probability of union for mutually exclusive events is:

$P(\cup^\infty_{i=1}E_i)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(E_i)$
