\subsection{The probability function}

For all events \(E\) in \(F\), the probability function \(P\) is defined.

\subsubsection{Measure space}

This gives us the following measure space:

\((\Omega, F, P)\)

\subsubsection{Kolmogorov axioms}

First axiom

The probability of all events is a non-negative real number.

\(\forall E \in F [(P(E)\ge 0)\land (P(E)\in \mathbb{R})]\)

Second axiom

The probability of one of the elementary events occuring is \(1\).

The probability of the outcome set is \(1\).

\(P(\Omega )=1\)

Third axiom

The probability of union for mutually exclusive events is:

\(P(\cup^\infty_{i=1}E_i)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(E_i)\)
