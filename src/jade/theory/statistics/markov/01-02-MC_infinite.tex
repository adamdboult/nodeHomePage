\subsection{Estimating infinite state Markov chains}

We can represent the transition matrix as a series of rules to reduce the number of dimensions

\(P(x_t |y_{t-1})=f(x,y)\)



can represent states as number, rather than atomic. could be continuous, or even real.

in more complex, can use vectors.
