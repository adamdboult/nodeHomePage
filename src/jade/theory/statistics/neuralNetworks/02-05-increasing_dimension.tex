\subsection{Increasing numbers of dimensions in a unit}

Topology of layers. Increasing number of units in subsequent layers is like increasing dimension.

We are trying to make data linearly separable. it may be that we need additional dimensions to do this, rather than a series of transformations within the existing number of dimensions.

eg for a circle of data within a circle of data, there is no linear separable line, so no depth without increasing dimensions will split data.
