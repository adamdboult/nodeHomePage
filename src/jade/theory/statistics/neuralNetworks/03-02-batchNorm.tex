\subsection{Batch normalisation}

We can normalise other layers. We take each input, subtract the batch mean divided by the batch standard deviation.

\subsubsection{Batch normalisation and covariance shift}

Batch normalisation can make networks better adapted for related problems.

\subsubsection{Training with batch normalisation}
