\subsection{Unstable gradient problem}

\subsubsection{Vanishing gradient problem}

Gradients can be become small, and so propagation can be very slow.

\subsubsection{Exploding gradient problem}

Gradients can become too large and not converge.

\subsubsection{ReLU}

This addresses the unstable gradient problem.
