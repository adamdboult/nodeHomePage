\subsection{Pearson correlation coefficient}

The Pearson correlation coefficient is definited as the covariance normalised by the individual variances.

It is between \(-1\) (total negative linear correlation), \(0\) (no linear correlation) and \(1\) (total negative linear correlation). 

\(p_{X,Y}=\frac{cov (X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}\)
