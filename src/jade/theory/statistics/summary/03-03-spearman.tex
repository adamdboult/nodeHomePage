\subsection{Spearman rank correlation}

\subsubsection{Ranking variables}

For each of \(2\) variables we create a ranking of them.

From \(X\) and \(Y\) we then have \(R_X\) and \(R_Y\).

\subsubsection{Calculating the Spearman rank correlation}

We then calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the rankings.

\(r_S=\frac{cov(R_X, R_Y)}{\sigma_{R_X}\sigma_{R_Y}}\)
