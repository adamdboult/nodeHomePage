\subsection{Splitting data into classes}

We have \(X\), and we want to split this into \(m\) different matrices.

We can do this by creating an index for each group, \(v\), where it is \(1\) if in the group and \(0\) otherwise.

We then select \(X[v]\).

Alternatively we can do \(v^TX\), however we must then trim the extra variables.
