\subsection{Bayesian classifier}

\subsubsection{Classification risk}

We can measure the risk of a classifier. This is the chance of misclassification.

\(R(C)=P(C(X)\ne Y)\)

\subsubsection{The Bayesian classifier}

This is the classifer \(C(X)\) which minimises the chance of misclassification.

It takes the output of the soft classifier and chooses the one with the highest chance.
