\subsection{Hard and soft classifiers}

A hard classifier can return a sparce vector with \(1\) in the relevant classification.

A soft classifier returns probabilities for each entry in the vector.

The vector represents  \(P(Y=k|X=x)\)

\subsubsection{Transforming soft classifiers into hard classifiers}

We can use a cutoff.

If there are more than two classes we can choose the one with the highest score.
