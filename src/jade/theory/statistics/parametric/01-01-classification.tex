\subsection{Classification}

Classification models are a type of regression model, where \(y\) is discrete rather than continuous.

So we want to find a mapping from a vector \(X\) to probabilities across discrete \(y\) values.

A classifier takes \(X\) and returns a vector.

For a classifier we have \(K\) classes.
