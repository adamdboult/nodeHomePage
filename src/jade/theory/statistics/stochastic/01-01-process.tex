\subsection{Stochastic processes}

In a stochastic process we have a mapping from a variable (time) to a random variable.

\subsubsection{Discrete and continuous time}

Time could be discrete, or continuous.

Temperature over time is a stochastic process, as is the number of cars sold each day.

\subsubsection{Discrete and continous state space}

The state space for temperature is continous, the number of people on the moon is discrete.
