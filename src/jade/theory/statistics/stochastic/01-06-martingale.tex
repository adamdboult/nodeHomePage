\subsection{The Markov and Martingale properties}

\subsubsection{Markov property}

For a process with the Markov property, only the current state matters for all probability distributions.

\(P(x_{t+n}|x_t)=P(x_{t+n}|x_t, x_{t-1}...)\)

\subsubsection{Martingale property}

For a process with the Martingale property, the expected value of all future variables is the current state.

This only restricts expectations.

\(E(X_{n+1}|X_0,...,X_n)=X_n\)

\subsubsection{Taxonomy}

A process can be Markov, Martingale, neither or both.
