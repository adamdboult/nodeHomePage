\subsubsection{Introduction}

We can use a version of Metropolis-Hastings to find the global maximum of a function \(f(x)\).

We start with an arbitrary point \(x_0\).

We move randomly from this to identiy a candidate point \(x_c\).

We accept this with probability depending on the the relationship between \(x_0\) and \(x_c\).

This process will converge on the global maximum.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter}

There is a hyperparameter for selection. At the extreme this becomes a greedy function.
