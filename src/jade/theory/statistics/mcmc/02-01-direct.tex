\subsection{Direct sampling]

\subsubsection{Density estimation through direct sampling}

There is distribution \(P(x)\) which we want to know more about.

If the function was closed, we could estimate it by using values of \(x\).

\subsubsection{Limitations of direct sampling}

However if the function does not have such a form, we cannot do that.

We can't plug in values, because the function is complex.

Sometimes we may know a function of the form:

\(f(x)=cP(x)\)

That is, a multiple of the function.

This can happen from Bayes' theorem:

\(P(y|x)=\frac{P(x|y)P(y)}{P(x)}\)

We may be able to estimate \(P(x|y)\) and \(P(y)\), but not \(P(x)\)

This means be have 

\(P(y|x)=cP(x|y)P(y)\)
