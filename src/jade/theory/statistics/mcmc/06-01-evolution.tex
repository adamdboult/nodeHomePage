\subsection{Evolutionary algorithms}

\subsubsection{Initialisation}

We generate a set of candidate parameter values, \(x\).

\subsubsection{Evaluate using the fitness function}

We evaluate each of these against a fitness function (the function we are optimising).

We assign fitness values to each individual.

\subsubsection{Crossover and mutation}

We generate a second generation. We select "parents" randomly using the fitness values as weightings.

The values of the new individual are a function of the values of the parents, and noise (mutation).

We do this for each member in the next generation.

We iterate this process across successive generations.
