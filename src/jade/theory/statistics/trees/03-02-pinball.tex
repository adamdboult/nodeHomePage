\subsection{The pinball prior}

We can generate a tree with a fixed number of leaves, according to our prior.

As we start the tree we assocaite the root node with a count of all leaves.

As we split a node, the remaining leaf counts are divided between the directions. If there is only one leaf left, we do no further splitting.
