\subsection{Interest}

\subsubsection{Interest}

An alternative measure for finding rules is to use interest.

\(Interest(A\rightarrow B)=\dfrac{P(A\land B)}{P(A)P(B)}\)

\(Interest(A\rightarrow B)=\dfrac{supp(A\land B)}{P(supp(A))P(supp(B))}\)

If this is \(1\), then they are independent.

If this is greater than \(1\), they are positively dependent.

If this is less than \(1\), they are negatively dependent.
