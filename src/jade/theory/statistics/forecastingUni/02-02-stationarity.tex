\subsection{Testing for stationarity with Dickey-Fuller (DF) and Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF)}

\subsubsection{Stationarity]

\subsubsection{Unit roots}


\subsubsection{Integration order}

\subsubsection{Dickey-Fuller}

The Dickey-Fuller test tests if there is a unit root.

The AR(\(1\)) model is:

\(y_t=\alpha + \beta y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t\)

We can rewrite this as:

\(\Delta y_t=\alpha + (\beta -1)y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t\)

We test if \(\beta -1)=0\).

If the coefficient on the last term is \(1\) we have a random walk, and the process is non-stationary.

If the last term is \(<1\) then we have a stationary process.

\subsubsection{Variation: Removing the drift}

If our model has no intercept it is:

\(y_t=\beta y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t\)

\(\Delta y_t=(\beta -1)y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t\)

\subsubsection{Variation: Adding a deterministic trend}

If our model has a time trend it is:

\(y_t=\alpha \beta y_{t-1}+\gamma t + \epsilon_t\)

\(\Delta y_t=\alpha + (\beta -1)y_{t-1}+\gamma t+\epsilon_t\)

\subsubsection{Augmented Dickey-Fuller}

We include more lagged variables.

\(y_t=\alpha + \beta t + \sum_i^p \theta_i y_{t-i}+\epsilon_t\)

If no unit root, can do normal OLS?
