\subsection{The jackknife}

We have a statistic:

\(S(x_1, x_2,...,x_n)\)

We may want to estimate moments for this statistic, but are unable to do so.

\subsubsection{The jackknife estimator}

The jackknife is an approach for getting moments for statistics.

We start by creating \(n\) statistics each leaving out one observation. 

\(\bar S_i(x_1,x_2,...x_{i-1},x_{i+1},...,x_n)\)

We define:

\(\bar S=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_i\bar S_i\)

\subsubsection{Moments of the jackknife estimator}

We want to know the variance.

\(Var \bar S=\frac{n-1}{n}\sum_i(\bar S_i-\bar S)^2\).
