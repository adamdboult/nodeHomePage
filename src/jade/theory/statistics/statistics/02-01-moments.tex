\subsection{Bias from single and joint estimation}

\subsubsection{Bias from single estimation}

\(\mathbf x_i\) and \(\mathbf z_i\) are not independent, so we cannot estimate just \(y_i=\mathbf x_i\theta \).

\subsubsection{Bias from joint estimation}

We could estimate our equation with a single ML algorithm.

\(y_i=f(\mathbf x_i, \theta) +g(\mathbf z_i) +\epsilon_i\)

For example, using LASSO.

However this would introduce bias into our estimates for \(\theta \).

\subsubsection{Bias from iterative estimation}

We could iteratively estimate both \(\theta \) and \(g(\mathbf z_i)\).

For example iteratvely doing OLS for \(\theta \) and random forests for \(z_i\).

This would also introduce bias into \(\thete \).
