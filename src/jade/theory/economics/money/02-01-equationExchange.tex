\subsection{The equation of exchange}

As there’s only so much stuff out there, an increase in the amount of money moving around with cause inflation.

This can be shown as:

\(MV=PQ\)

The amount of money (M) multiplied by the velocity at which money moves (V) must be equal to the average price (P) multiplied by the quantity of stuff (Q). This isn’t a theory, it’s an accounting identity.
