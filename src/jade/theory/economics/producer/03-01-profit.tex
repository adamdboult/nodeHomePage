\subsubsection{Revenue}

The revenue of a firm is:

\(pq\)

Where \(q\) is the amount producted, and \(p\) is the price.

\subsubsection{Cost}

The costs of a firm are:

\(c\)

Where \(c\) is a function of production.

Link to production function???


\subsubsection{Profit}

The profit of a firm is the difference between revenue and costs.

\(\pi = pq-c\)



\subsection{Monopoly pricing}

\(\pi = pq-c\)

The firm's production \(q\) affects the market price \(p\).

\(\dfrac{\delta \pi }{\delta q}= \dfrac{\delta }{\delta q} [pq-c]\)

\(\dfrac{\delta \pi }{\delta q}= p+q\dfrac{\delta p}{\delta q}-\dfrac{\delta c}{\delta q}\)

The firm chooses \(Q\) to maximise profits.

\(p+q\dfrac{\delta p}{\delta q}=\dfrac{\delta c}{\delta q}\)

The right side is marginal costs (MC), the left is marginal revenue.

\(p[1+\dfrac{q}{p}\dfrac{\delta p}{\delta q}]=MC\)

We know that the price elasticity of demand is: \(\epsilon = \dfrac{p}{q}\dfrac{\delta q}{\delta p}\)

So we have:

\(p[1+\dfrac{1 }{\epsilon }]=MC\)

\(p=\dfrac{\epsilon }{1+\epsilon }MC\)
