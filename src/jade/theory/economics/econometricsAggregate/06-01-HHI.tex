\subsection{Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)}

The index is the sum of each firm’s market share squared.

For a monopolist this is \(1\), for a completely competitive market it is \(0\), or \(\dfrac{1}{n}\).

\(H=\sum_{i=1}^ns^2_i\)

To normalise this between \(0\) and \(1\) we can use:

\(H*=\dfrac{H-\dfrac{1}{n}}{1-\dfrac{1}{n}}\)
