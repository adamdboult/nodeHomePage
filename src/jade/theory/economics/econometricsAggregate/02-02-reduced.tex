\subsection{Reduced form equations}

Where supply is demand.

\(Q_s=Q_d\)

\(\alpha_1 + \beta_1P+\gamma_1I + \epsilon_1=\alpha_2 + \beta_2P+\gamma_2I + \epsilon_2\)

\((\alpha_1 -\alpha_2) + (\beta_1- \beta_2)P+(\gamma_1-\gamma_2) I + (\epsilon_1-\epsilon_2)=0\)


\((\beta_1- \beta_2)P=-(\alpha_1 -\alpha_2) - (\gamma_1-\gamma_2) I - (\epsilon_1-\epsilon_2)\)

\(P=-\dfrac{\alpha_1 -\alpha_2}{\beta_1- \beta_2} - \dfrac{\gamma_1-\gamma_2}{\beta_1- \beta_2} I - \dfrac{\epsilon_1-\epsilon_2}{\beta_1- \beta_2}\)

We can construct something similar for \(Q\). The results are reduced-form parameters with reduced-form errors.


\subsection{More on reduced form}

reduced form for perfect competition, and imperfect

issue is: supply function only defined for perfect competition.

how do you get equilibrium otherwise? what are the other reduced form equations? strucutral?
