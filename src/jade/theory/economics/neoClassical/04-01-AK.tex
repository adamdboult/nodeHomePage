\subsection{The AK model}

\subsubsection{Recap of growth models}

As with the Harrod-Domar model we have output as a function of capital:

\(Y=f(K)\)

Capital dynamics:

\(\dot K=I-\delta K\)

\(I=S=sY\)

This gives us:

\(\dot K = sY-\delta K\)

\subsubsection{Recap of the Harrod-Domar and Solow-Swan models}

In the Solow-Swan model the production function was:

\(Y=K^\alpha (AL)^{1-\alpha }\)

In the Harrod-Domar model the production function was:

\(Y=cK\)

In the Solow-Swan model we also added population and technology growth

\subsubsection{The AK model}

In the AK model the production function is:

\(Y=AK\)

We keep population growth from the Solow-Swan model.

\subsubsection{Per-capita income}

\(\dot K = sAK-\delta K\)

\(\dot K = (sA-\delta )K\)

\(k=\dfrac{K}{L}\)

\(\dot k =\dfrac{\dot K}{L}-\dot L\dfrac{K}{L^2}\)

\(\dot k =\dfrac{(sA-\delta )K}{L}-\dot L\dfrac{K}{L^2}\)

\(\dot k =(sA-\delta )k-k\dfrac{\dot L}{L}\)

\(\dot k =(sA-\delta -n)k\)

\(\dfrac{\dot k}{k} =sA-\delta -n\)
