\subsection{The Investment Saving - Liquidity preference - Money supply (IS-LM) model}

The IS curve plots output against the (real) interest rate. As (real) interest rates rise, investment and therefore output falls.

The LM curve plots output against the (nominal) interest rate. As output rises, (nominal) interest rates fall to ensure clearing.

As prices are fixed in the IS-LM model, we can use the real and nominal rates interchangably.

The IS-LM model identifies the intercepts of the two curves and the equilibrium output and interest rate.

This model takes prices, money supply, taxes and government spending to be exogenous.

\subsubsection{Effect of monetary expansion}

In the LM model a monetary expansion lowers interest rates.

In the IS-LM model this effect is lessened. The lower interest rates cause higher output, increasing money demand, and raising interest rates.

\subsubsection{Effect of fiscal expansion}

Is the IS model a fiscal expansion caused a corresponding increase in output.

In the IS-LM model this is lessened because the increase also causes more real money demand, raising interest rates, and lowering output.
