\subsection{The Liquidity preference - Money supply (LM) curve}

\subsubsection{Liquidity preference}

Money demand is:

\(L=L(i, Y)\)

As income rises, demand for money rises.

As the nominal interest rate rises, the demand for money falls, due to the opportunity cost.

\subsubsection{Money supply}

Money supply is:

\(\dfrac{M}{P}\)

\subsubsection{The LM curve}

In equilibrium money supply and demand match. We have:

\(\dfrac{M}{P}=L(i,Y)\)

We can plot the level of output which corresponds to the nominal interest rate.

This is the LM curve.

\subsubsection{The slope of the LM curve}
