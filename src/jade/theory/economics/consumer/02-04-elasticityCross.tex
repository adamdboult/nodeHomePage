\subsection{Cross-price elasticity of demand, complements and substitutes}

\subsubsection{Derivative of Marshallian demand}

We have our demand function:

\(x_i=x_{di}(I, \mathbf p)\)

The derivative of this with respect to price is the additional amount consumed after prices increase.

\(\dfrac{\delta }{p_i}x_{di}(I, \mathbf p)\)
