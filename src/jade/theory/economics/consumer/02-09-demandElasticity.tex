\subsubsection{Measuring demand elasticity}

Demand elasticity

we measure elsaticities as they are. there may be existing cmpetition barriers which cause current substitution. without current monopolies, there may be more unique markets.

eg monopolist has product with sbustitutve, but it is only substitute because the monopolist has kept the price so high.

hard to measure elasticity due to endogeneity. better approach would be look for external shocks or surveys for demand elasticity

\subsubsection{Estimating}

Let's say the demand function is:

\(Q=\alpha+\beta P + \epsilon \)

How can we estimate this?

OLS will give biased results if \(P\) is correlated with \(\epsilon \).

We can estimate if we have an instrumental variable for \(P\).
