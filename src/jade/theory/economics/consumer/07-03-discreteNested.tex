\subsection{Modelling homogeneous preferences with nested logit}

\subsubsection{Nested logit}

With IID all goods are equal substitutes. If prices rise customers will switch to others in proportion to market size.

In practice if the price of a cheap car rises, there will be more substitution to other cheap cars than expensive cars.

Nested logit can address this.

\subsubsection{Estimating the nested logit model}

As with the multinomial logit model, we have prices, market shares and product characteristics.

\subsubsection{Own-price elasticity of demand}

\subsubsection{Cross-price elasticty of demand}
