\subsection{Normal goods}

As income rises, demand also rises.

This is the same as saying the income elasticity of demand is above \(0\).

\(\xi_i =\dfrac{\delta x_{di}}{\delta I}\dfrac{I}{x_{di}}\)

\subsection{Inferior goods}

An inferior good is one where the demand falls as income increases.

This is the same as the income elasticity of demand being less than \(0\).

\subsection{Necessities}

Necessities are goods which increase in demand as income rises, but by a smaller proportion.

The income elasticity of demand is between \(0\) and \(1\).

\subsection{Luxuries}

Luxuries are goods which increase in demand as income rises, by a larger proportion.

The income elasticity of demand is above \(1\).
