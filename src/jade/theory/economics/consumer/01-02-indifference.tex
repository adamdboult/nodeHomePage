\subsection{Indifference curves}

We have \(U=f(x,y)\)

An indifference curve is a curve where a consumer is indifferent to all points on it.

\(f(x,y)=c\).

\subsection{Marginal rate of substitution}

The marginal rate of substitution is the amount of one good that a customer is willing to give up for another.

This is the gradient of the indifference curve.

\(MRS(x, y)=\dfrac{MU(x)}{MU(y)}\)
