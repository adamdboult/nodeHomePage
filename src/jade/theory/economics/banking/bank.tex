\subsection{Banks}

Banks get revenue from their lending activities. Their costs include identifying investment opportunities and paying interest to depositors.

Is the bank system more wasteful because it has reserves? Not really â€“ reserves are needed because the bank deposits are on demand. If Alice received funds directly from each one she would keep some in reserve herself, in case someone demanded money back. What the bank does is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Make identifying investment opportunities simpler
\item Matching short term depositors with long term borrowers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Investments and time requirements, and search costs for investment}
