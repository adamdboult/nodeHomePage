\subsection{Continuous utility functions}

With non-discrete choice a consumer chooses how much of product \(x\) to consume.

The utility function is of the form:

\(U_i(x_1,...,x_m;d)\)

And the consumer chooses how much of \(x_i\) to consume to maximise this, subject to the budget constraint.

We include features relating to the individual, \(d\).

\subsection{Discrete choice}

The utility customer \(i\) gets from product \(j\) is:

\(U_{ij}=f_i(p,d)+\epsilon_{ij}\)

The customer chooses the product with the highest utility.

\subsection{The outside option}

We need to know the market share of the outside option. Do this theoretically. Eg number of customers in area, and 1 per day.
