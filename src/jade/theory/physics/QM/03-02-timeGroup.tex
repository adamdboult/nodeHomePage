\subsubsection{Discrete time}

With discrete time we can use a canonical operator for moving between discrete states in single jumps.

With discrete time there must a countable number of states.

We can index time to the integers.

At time \(0\) we have \(v\)

At time \(1\) we have \(\Psi v\)

At time \(2\) we have \(\Psi \Psi v\)

We can write this as \(\Psi (t_1,t_0)=\Psi ^{t_1-t_0}\)
