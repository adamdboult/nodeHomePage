\subsection{Continous time with Lie algebra}

We use \(X=iH\), what are the implications of this compared to other choices?

Lie algebras with \(n\times x\)

This loops back? multiple dimensions, infinite, so maybe not?

With continuous time we do not have a single operator to describe movements. There is always one smaller.

With continous time there must be either a single state, or an uncountably infinite number of states.

\(U=M_n^n\)

\(U=(I+\dfrac{1}{n}G_n)^n\)

\(U=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }(I+\dfrac{1}{n}G)^n\)

Now:

\(UU^*=I\)

\((I+\dfrac{1}{n}G)(I+\dfrac{1}{n}G)^*=I\)

\((I+\dfrac{1}{n}G)(I+\dfrac{1}{n}G^*)=I\)

\(G=-G^*\)

\(G=iH\)

\(iH=-(iH)^*\)

\(H=H^*\)

\(H\) is Hermitian

\(U=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }(I+\dfrac{1}{n}iH)^n\)

This isn't quite right, need defined for different time jumps.
