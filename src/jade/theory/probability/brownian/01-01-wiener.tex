\subsection{Independent increments}

The changes in any non-overlapping time increments are independent.

Formally:

\(t_0<t_1<t_2<...<t_m\)

With \(X_t\)

\(X_{t_1}-X_{t_0}\) is indepentent from \(X_{t_2}-X{t_1}\) etc.

\subsection{Wiener processes}

A Wiener process is a process \(W_t\) with independent increments, which:
+ Is continuous
+ Has normally distributed increments.

Can be constructed as limit of random walk.
Can also be constructed as integral of Gaussian noise?
