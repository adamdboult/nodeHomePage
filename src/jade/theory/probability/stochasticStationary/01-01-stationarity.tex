\subsection{Weak- and wide-sense stationarity}

Unconditional probabilities don't change over time.

So GDP would not be stationary, but random noise would. A random walk is not stationary, because the variance increases over time.

\subsection{Weak-sense stationary}

Mean and autocovarinance don't change over time.

\subsection{Wide-sense stationary}

All moments are the same.
