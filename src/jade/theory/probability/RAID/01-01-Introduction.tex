\subsection{Introduction}

Take physical disk drives, create logical disk drives.

\subsection{Striping}

A single file is spread over multiple disks.

Can be done at bit/byte/block level.

\subsection{Mirroring}

Same data on multiple drives

\subsection{Parity}

Used for error detection.

In protocol for sending/saving we say that all bits must be even (eg 1100) (or odd)

For given bit of info, we add parity bit to guarantee that bit is indeed even/odd. 1100 becomes 11000; 1000 becomes 10000

Cannot correct errors, just detect them. only detects if odd number of errors.

Parity can be stored on dedicate disk, distributed.

alternative to parity bit: hamming code

\subsection{RAID levels}

RAID 0: Uses striping across disks, but no redunency. allows for improved read/write times. if any drive fails, all fail
RAID 1: Data written identically to two drives. read times increased, as with raid 0, due to mirroring. writing is slower. no parity or striping
RAID 2: bit level striping and hamming code. rarely used
RAID 3: rarely used. byte level stripping. Dedicated parity disk
RAID 4: dedicated parity disk
RAID 5: block level striping, distributed parity
RIAD 6: double distributed parity

\subsection{ZFS}

RAID-Z: Under ZFC, similar to RAID 5

\subsection{Off-site backups}
