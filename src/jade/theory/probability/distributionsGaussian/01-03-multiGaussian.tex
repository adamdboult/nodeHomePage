\subsection{Multivariable Gaussian distribution}

\subsubsection{Definition}

For univariate:

\(x \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2 )\)

We define the multivariate gaussian distribution as the distribution where any linear combination of components are gaussian.

For multivariate:

\(X \sim N(\mu, \Sigma )\)

Where \(\mu \) is now a vector, and \(\Sigma \) is the covariance matrix.

Density function is :

\(f_x=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt {(2\pi )^n|\Sigma |}} e^{-\dfrac{1}{2}(x-\mu )^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}\)

For normal gaussian it is:

\(f_x=\dfrac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi |\sigma^2}} e^{-\dfrac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu )^2)}\)

This is the same wher \(n=1\).

\subsubsection{Singular Gaussians}

Need det \(|\Sigma |\) and \(\Sigma^{-1}\). These rely on the covariance matrix not being degenerate.

If the covariance matrix is degenerate we can instead use the pseudo inverse, and the pseudo determinant.
