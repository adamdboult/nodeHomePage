\subsection{Gamma function}

The gamma function expands the factorial function to the real (and complex) numbers

We want:

\(f(1)=1\)

\(f(x+1)=xf(x)\)

There are an infinite number of functions which fit this. The function could fluctuate between the natural numbers.

The function we use is:

\(\Gamma (z)=\int_0^\infty x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx\)
