\subsection{Introduction to unconstrained optimisation}

\subsubsection{Goals}

We want to identify either the maximum or the minimum.

There exist local minima and global minima.

\subsubsection{Optimising through limits}

If we are looking to minimise a function, and the limits are \(\infty \) or \(-\infty \) then we can optimise by taking large or small values.

We can examine this for each variable.

This also applies for maximising a function.

\subsubsection{Optimisation through stationary points}

Stationary points of a function are points where marginal changes do not have an impact on the value of the function. As a result they are either local maxima or minima.

\subsubsection{Optimisation through algorithms}

If we cannot identify stationary points easily, we can instead use algorithms to identify optima.

\subsubsection{Stationary points of strictly concave and convex functions}

If a function is strictly concave it will only have one stationary point, a local, and global, maxima.

If a function is strictly convex it will only have one stationary point, a local, and global, minima.
