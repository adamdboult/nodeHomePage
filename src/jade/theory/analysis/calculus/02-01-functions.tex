\subsection{Differentiable functions}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

A differentiable function is one where the differential is defined at all points on the real line.

All differentiable functions are continuous. Not all continuous functions are differentiable.

\subsubsection{Differentiability class}

We can describe a function with its differentiability class. If a function can be differentiated \(n\) times and these differentials are all continous, then the function is class \(C^n\).

\subsubsection{Smooth functions}

If a function can be differentiated infinitely many times to produce continous functions, it is \(C^{\infty }\), or smooth.
