\subsection{Scalar fields}

A scalar field is a function on an underlying input which produces a real output.

Inputs are not limited to real numbers. In this section we consider functions on vector spaces.

\subsection{Del}

\(\nabla =(\sum_{i=1}^n e_i\dfrac{\delta }{\delta x_i})\)

Where \(e\) are the basis vectors.

This on its own means nothing. It is similar to the partial differentiation function.
