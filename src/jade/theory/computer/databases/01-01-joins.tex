\subsection{Joins}

Have index common to two tables

\subsubsection{Cross join}

Keep all columns. can name [table name].[column name] to preserve any differences. including for index (could be missing for some)

Not really matched if original n length, and other m, then new is n*m length. so all combinations of matches are kept

\subsubsection{Inner join}

Drops those where no match. means data dropped in index missing

Any predicate, equi join, equality predicate

\subsubsection{Outer join}

Keep data if none matches. left outer join for one table, right outer join for other, or full outer join
