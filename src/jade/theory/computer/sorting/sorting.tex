\subsection{Sorting algorithms}

There can be a total ordering on elements in a list.

We want to return a list such that

Only the ordering is changed

\(\forall nm [list[n]>list[m] \leftrightarrow n>m]\)

Efficient in time and memory

Popular algorithms are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Merge sort
\item Quick sort
\item Heap sort
\end{itemize}
