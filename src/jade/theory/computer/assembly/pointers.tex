\subsection{Pointers}

So in first case we have \(x=2\) and \(y=2\), and then we want to change both to \(3\).

In first example, initiate both and store \(2\) in memory twice. update both.

In second example we can have x and y have the same value of a pointer, pointing to a third memory location. we can the update this memory location to change both to \(3\).

Two variable can be the same by value, but additionally by pointer.

eg \(x=2\) and \(y=2\). \(x==y\), but if they have the same pointer, they are the same thing. changing one changes the other.

We can update \(x\) and \(y\) will automatically update

When we say \(x=2\), \(y=x\) we are either making \(y\) mutable or immutable. mutable means same pointer. language specific rules apply.
