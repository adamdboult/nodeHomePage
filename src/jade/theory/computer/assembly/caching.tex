\subsection{Integer caching}

If we set \(x=2\)  we can either create \(2\) in memory, or simply point \(x\) to \(2\), which is already in memory

That means if we do \(x=2\) \(y=2\) they have the same pointer.

Can also cache some other common data values, eg empty lists.

Makes sense if pointer is smaller in memory than value.
