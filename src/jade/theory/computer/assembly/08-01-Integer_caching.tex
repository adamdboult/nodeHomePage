\subsection{Integer caching}


if we set x =2  we can either create 2 in memory, or simply point x to 2, which is already in memory

that means if we do x=2 y=2 they have the same pointer

can also cache some other common data values, eg empty lists

makes sense if pointer is smaller in memory than value
