\subsection{A* search}

If the heuristic is admissible, then a* is optimal. Intuitively because the the heuristic steers away from any suboptimal solutions.

Admissible? For all nodes n , h(n)<=h*(n). where h* is true cost

\(f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\)

\(g(n\) is the cost to reach \(n\) from the current position.

Informed: Yes

Time: Exponential

Space: Big, all nodes kept in memory

Complete: Yes

Optimal: Yes, if the heuristic is admissible
