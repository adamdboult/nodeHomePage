\subsection{Depth-first search}

A depth-first search operates Last-in First-out (LiFo). That is, it selects the newest frontier node. This results in a deep, rather than a broad search. Once the maximum depth has been reached, the algorithm will move towards breadth. Path cost is not considered in this algorithm.
