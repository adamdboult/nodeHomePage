\subsection{Breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers with frequency analysis}

(need to identify algorithm and needs to identify key)

finding substitution cyphers

Search space is larger, \(26!=4*10^26\). need alternative to brute force.


Letter popularity. Compare against popularity for corpus. 
Monogram (ie letters); ngrams(ie n letter in a row frequency); common words.


Single letter words are I or A. More generally. corpus smaller for fewer letters

Can test substitution cypher by matching each word against a corpus
