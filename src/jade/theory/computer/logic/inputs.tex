\subsection{Inputs}

A single bit can store a binary piece of information. We can use it to distinguish between two states.

These two states could be represented by True \(T\) and False \(F\), but by convention we use \(1\) and \(0\).

We can combine bits to store more complex pieces of information. If we have \(n\) bits, we can distinguish between \(2^n\) states.

Eight bits together constitute a byte. This can represent one of \(2^8=256\) states.
