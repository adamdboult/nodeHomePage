\subsection{Finite-state machines}

A finite-state machine has \(n\) states. The machine moves through these states through the use of inputs, and the movement between these states can be represented by a graph.

We can represent the machine with table. One axis shows the inputs, the other the states. The cells can be filled with (if available) movements between the states.

Similar to combinatorial logic, but output is the new state.
