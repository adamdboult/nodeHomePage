\subsection{Sort}


\subsection{Data integrity checks}

Hash functions (take input and return fixed length output) (\(h=hash(m)\))
Needs to be very different for small changes. so typo has different hash for example. corrput data needs to be noticed.
Checksums (if two files are the same then hashes the same)

\subsection{Adversaries}

Brute force attacks

Pre-image attacks (h3 on attack, h3 on defence: Given hash value \(h\), can we find message \(m\)?)
Second pre-image attacks (h3 on attack, h3 on defence: given \(m_1\), can we find \(m_2\) with same hash?)
Hash collisions (h3 on attack, h3 on defence: can i find any two matching messages? )

\subsection{Passwords}

Plaintext databases

Hashed passwords

Rainbow tables

Salting

\subsection{Hash functions}
+ SHA
