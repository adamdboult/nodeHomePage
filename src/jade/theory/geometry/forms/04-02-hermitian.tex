\subsection{Hermitian (self-adjoint) matrices}

A matrix where \(M=M^*\)

For matrices over the real numbers, these are the same as symmetric matrices.

\subsubsection{Sesqulinear forms on Hermitian matrices}

\(\phi (u,v)=u^*Mv\)

\((u^*Mv)^*=v^*M^*u=v^*Mu\)

\(\phi (u,v)=\overline {\phi (v,u)}\)

\subsubsection{The forms on the same vector are always real}

\((v^*Mv)^*=v^*M^*v=v^*Mv\)

So we have:

\((v^*Mv)^*=v^*Mv\)

Which is only satisfied for reals.

\subsubsection{If \(A\) and \(B\) are Hermitian}

If \(A\) and \(B\) are Hermitian, \(AB\) is Hermitian if and only if \(AB\) commutes.

\((AB)^*=B^*A^*=BA\)

If it commutes then

\((AB)^*=AB\)

\subsubsection{Real eigenvalues}

Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues.

\(Hv=\lambda v\)

\(v^*Hv=\lambda v^*v\)

\(v^*Hv=\lambda \)

\subsubsection{Skew-Hermitian matrices}

These are also known as anti-Hermitian matrices.

\(M^*=-M\)

\subsubsection{If eigenvalues are different, eigenvectors are orthogonal}
