\subsection{Endomorphisms on real functions}

We start with our vector \(f(x)\).

\(h(x)=f(x)g(x)\)

The equivalent of the identity matrix is where \(g(x)=1\).

These are similar to endomorphisms where all off diagonal elements are \(0\).

\subsubsection{Differentiation}

\(h(x)=\dfrac{\delta }{\delta x}f(x)\)

\subsubsection{Integration}

\(h(x)=\int_{-\infty }^x f(z) dz\)
