\subsection{Vector bundles}

A vector bundle consists of a base manifold (a base space), and a real vector space at each point in the base manifold.

\subsubsection{Example}

For example we can have a base manifold of a circle, and have a \(1\)-dimensional vector space at each point on the circle to create an infinitely extended cylinder.
