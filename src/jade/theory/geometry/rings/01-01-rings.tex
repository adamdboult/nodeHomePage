\subsection{Rings}

Consider an abelian group \((S,+)\).

A ring takes this and adds a multiplicative function which satisfies the distributive property.

Groups have an identity element for their function. Rings must have identity elements for both their functions.

The multiplicative function does not have to be a bijection. For example the set of integers, addition and multiplication form a ring.
