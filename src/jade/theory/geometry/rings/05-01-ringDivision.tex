\subsection{Division rings}

A divison ring is a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

\subsubsection{Example}

The rational numbers are a divison ring.

\subsubsection{Relationship between divison rings and fields}

Fields (not yet introduced) are different from division rings only in that multiplication for a field must be commutative.
