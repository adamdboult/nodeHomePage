\subsection{Ideals}

An ideal is a subring where the multiplication of any element of the ideal with any element of the ring is also in the ideal.

\subsubsection{Examples}

Even numbers are an ideal of the integers.

Odd numbers are not an ideal. For example \(1\) is in the ideal, but multiplied by \(2\) gives \(2\), which is not in the ideal.
