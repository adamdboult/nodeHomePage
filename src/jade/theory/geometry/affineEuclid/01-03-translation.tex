\subsection{Translation symmetry}

The distance between two vectors is:

\((v-w)^TM(v-w)\)

So what operations can we do now?

As before, we can do the transformations which preserve \(u^TMv\), such as the orthogonal group.

But we can also do other translations

\((v-w)TM(v-w)\)

\(v^TMv+w^TMw-v^TMw-w^TMv\)

so symmetry is now \(O(3,1)\) and affine translations

\subsubsection{Translation matrix}

\([[1,x][0, 1]]\) moves vector by \(x\).
