\subsection{The pseudo-inverse}

The definition of the inverse  is that:

\(MM^{-1}=I\)

\(M^{-1}M=I\)

We also have:

\(MM^{-1}M=M\)

\(M^{-1}MM^{-1}=M^{-1}\)

\subsubsection{The inverse of a homomorphism}

Generally we don't have inverses of homomorphisms as the number of dimensions are different.

We can, however, find a matrix \(M^+\) which satisfies:

\(MM^+M=M\)

\(M^+MM^+=M^+\)

This is the pseudo-inverse.
