\subsection{Boundries and interiors}

The boundry of the subset \(S\) of a topology is the intersection with the closure of \(S\) with the closure of the complement of \(S\).

So the boundry of both \((0,1)\) and \([0,1]\) are \(0\) and \(1\).

The interior of \(S\) is \(S\) without the boundry.

So the interior of \((0,1)\) and \([0,1]\) are both \((0,1)\).
