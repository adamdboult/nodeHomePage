\subsection{Complete preferences}

\subsubsection{Axiom 2: An economic agent has preferences across all pairs of elements of the choice set}

Where an agent prefers one option to another, we say this choice is preferred to the other. We can show this formulaically. If \(a\) is preferred to \(b\) then:

\(a\succ b\)

Alternatively \(b\) may be preferred to \(a\).

\(a\prec b\)

Finally an agent may be indifferent to the choices.

\(a\sim b\)

We use can additional symbols to denote an agent prefers or is indifferent between options:

\(a\succeq b\)

\(a\preceq b\)

Note that if:

\(a\succeq b\)

And:

\(a\preceq b\)

Then:

\(a\sim b\)

For a set of choice, we want the agent to have preferences defined across possible subsets â€“ the power set.

Add symbols for choice across a set. include symbols for choice of a set, x =c({a,b},utility)

a>b etc only for pairwise, but preferences are across more than that

Discussion of repeated. agents don't choose the same thing each time, interpretation?
