\subsection{Defining board games}

A board is described by:

\begin{itemize}
\item The layout of the board
\item Whose turn it is
\item Move history
\end{itemize}

These can be represented as nodes the root node being the start of the game, and each branch being a move taken.

The number of possible nodes can quickly become very large, as in chess and go.
