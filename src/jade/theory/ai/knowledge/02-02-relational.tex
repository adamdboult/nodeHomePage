\subsection{Relational learning}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Consider two facts:

Alice \(\rightarrow^{IsA }\) Doctor

Bob \(\rightarrow^{HasMother }\) Alice

We can consider another fact:

Bob \(\rightarrow^{IsA }\) Doctor

\subsubsection{Confidence of inferred facts}

How confident should we be of this?

In practice the graph between Bob and Doctor will have many paths (qualifications)
