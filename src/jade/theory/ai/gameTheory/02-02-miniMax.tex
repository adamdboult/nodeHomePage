\subsection{Minimax}
\subsubsection{Games}

Games are different to search. In a search algorithm we are looking for a sequence of actions. In a game we are looking for a reaction function. Unlike in seach, there are other players.

We can use iterative deepening search.

\subsubsection{Heuristics}

The search space can be too big to look through all the nodes. 

Rather than look for win states, we evaluate a non-terminal state using heuristics.

\subsubsection{Stochastic games}

Can use expectminimax

For max node, return highest expectminimax of children

For min node ---

For chance node, average of children weightted

Minimax: two players, max min

Max goes first, maximises results. min minimises results

A node's minimax value is the best outcome against best player.

To find optimal strategy, depth first search of game tree.

Propagate minimax values up tree as terminal nodes are discovered

If a state is terminal, its value is utility of state

If a state is max node, highest value of children

If a state is min node, lowest value of children

Minimax is optimal, complete (for finite trees)
