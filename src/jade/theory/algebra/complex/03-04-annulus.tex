\subsection{Disks}

We defined an open disk at \((a,b)\) of radius \(r\) as:

\(\{(x,y)\in \mathbb R^2:(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 < r^2\}\)

For a closed disk it is:

\(\{(x,y)\in \mathbb R^2:(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 \le r^2\}\)

\subsection{Annulus}

An annulus is a disk, which excludes a smaller disk inside the disk

\subsection{Punctured disk}

If the interior disk is just a point, it is a punctured disk.
