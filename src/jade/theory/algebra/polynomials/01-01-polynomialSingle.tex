\subsection{Introduction}

A single-variable polynomial is an equation of the form:

\(\sum^n_{i=0} a_i x^i=0\)

For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(x=1\)
\item \(x^2=4\)
\item \(x^2-3x+2=0\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Degrees}

The degree of a polynomial is the highest-order term.

For example \(x^3+x=0\) has degree \(3\).

\subsection{Roots of single-variable polynomials}

A solution to a polynomial is a root.

For example \(1\) and \(2\) are roots of \(x^2-3x+2=0\)
