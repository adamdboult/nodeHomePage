\subsection{SIR model with births and other deaths}

\subsection{Exposure period (SEIR model)}

Susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered.

\subsection{No lasting immunity (SIS model)}

can do \(SI_1SI_2\).

No lasting immunity

Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible

Infected model as before

\subsection{SIRS}

short period of no infection

\subsection{SEIS (with exposure)}

no long term immunity

\subsection{Sesonal effects}

\(\beta \) varies over time

\subsection{Maternal models}

MSIR

born with immunity

MSEIR

MSEIS
