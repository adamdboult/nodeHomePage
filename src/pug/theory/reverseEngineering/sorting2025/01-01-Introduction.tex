rom dumping

reverse engineering:
+ splitting out code from data/graphics/text

h3 on reverse engineering hardware
+ roms. identifying binary blobs from roms

h3 on software
+ split binary blob into code, text / images
+ uncompressing images/text
+ byte code to object code (does this require system call understanding? more than just assmebler right? need to understand linker?)
