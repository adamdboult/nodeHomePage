\subsection{Introduction}

Python get array size,  size of other iterables, sets

map and filters run on iterable. also the loops?
is a set an iterable?

+ conditional substitutions of lists in python

\subsection{Lists}

Python lists are dynamic arrays.

\begin{verbatim}

a = [1,2,3]

\end{verbatim}

Lists are mutable.

\subsection{List slices}

\subsection{List comprehensions}

\subsection{Lambda functions}
filter

+ map function
+ lambda functions

\subsection{Tuples}

\begin{verbatim}

a = (1,2,3)

\end{verbatim}

Tuples are immutable.

why not just use copy on write instead of tuples?
+ complex to implement?

why tuples
broadly safety
+ mean that if create one tuple based on another, deep copy?
if mutable
+ a=(1,2,3)
+ b=a
+ b[0]=2
  * this fails, but if it didn't we might get the following
+ print(a)
  * (2,2,3)
+ print(b)
  * (2,2,3)

with mutability can still do eg a=a[2] because this is creating a new thing and using it in name
immutability means can't do eg b[3] = 2
allows optimiser to assume not mutable. can cause speed ups
