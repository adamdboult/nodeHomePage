\subsection{Functions}

We can call a function:
\(y=f(x)\)

Here \(x\) are the local variables to be used.

However the global state may also affect the outcome, so we have:

\(y=f(x,z)\)

As a result, calling the same function twice with the same inputs can have different outputs.

Side effects. If a function modifies the state outside of its local variables it has side effects.
