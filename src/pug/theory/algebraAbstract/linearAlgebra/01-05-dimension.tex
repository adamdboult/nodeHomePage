\subsection{Dimension function}

For a basis \(S\), the the dimension of the vector space is \(|S|\).

\(\dim (V)=|S|\)

\(S\subset V\)

\subsubsection{Finite and infinite vector spaces}

If \(\dim (V) \) is finite, then we say the vector space is finite.

Otherwise, we say the vector space is infinite.
