\subsection{Magma}

A magma, or groupoid, is a set with a single binary operation.

These can be defined as an ordered pair \((s,\odot )\) where \(s\) is the set, and \(\odot \) is the binary operation.

If \(a\) and \(b\) are in \(s\), then \(a\odot b\) is also in \(s\).

The following are magmas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers and addition
\item \(n\times n\) matrices with determinants other than \(0\)
\item Natural numbers above \(0\) and addition
\item Integers and addition
\item Rational numbers and division
\item \(\{-1, 1\}\) and multiplication
\end{itemize}

The following are not magmas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers up to \(10\) and addition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semigroup}

A semigroup is a magma whose binary operation is associative.

The following are semigroups:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers and addition
\item \(n\times n\) matrices with determinants other than \(0\)
\item Natural numbers above \(0\) and addition
\item Integers and addition
\item \(\{-1, 1\}\) and multiplication
\end{itemize}

The following are not semigroups:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rational numbers and division
\item Natural numbers up to \(10\) and addition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monoid}

A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.

The following are monoids:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers and addition
\item \(n\times n\) matrices with determinants other than \(0\)
\item Integers and addition
\item \(\{-1, 1\}\) and multiplication
\end{itemize}

The following are not monoids:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers above \(0\) and addition
\item Rational numbers and division
\item Natural numbers up to \(10\) and addition
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Group}

A group is a monoid where there is an inverse operation for the binary operation.

The following are groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item Integers and addition
\item \(n\times n\) matrices with determinants other than \(0\)
\item \(\{-1, 1\}\) and multiplication
\end{itemize}

The following are not groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural numbers above \(0\) and addition
\item Rational numbers and division
\item Natural numbers and addition
\item Natural numbers up to \(10\) and addition
\end{itemize}
