\subsection{The finite cyclic groups (\(C_n\) or \(Z_n\))}

Consider the multiplicative group of \(< i >\).

This contains \(\{1,-1,i,-i \} \).

This is also automorphic to the natural number and modulo addition group above.

We can define finite cyclic groups of size \(n\) using the generating element \(z^{\dfrac{1}{n}}\). This is isomorphic to the general cyclic group \(C_n\), and to \(Z/nZ\).
