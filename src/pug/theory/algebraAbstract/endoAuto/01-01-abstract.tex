\subsection{Endomorphism}

An endomorphism is one where the domain and codomain are the same.

The following are endomorphisms:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(f(x)=0\)
\item \(f(x)=x\)
\item \(f(x)=cx\)
\end{itemize}

The following are not endomorphisms

\begin{itemize}
\item Converting natural numbers to integers
\item \(f(x)=x+1\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Automorphism}

An endomorphism which is also an isomorphism

The following are automorphisms:
\begin{itemize}
\item \(f(x)=x\)
\item \(f(x)=cx\)
\end{itemize}

The following are not automorphisms

\begin{itemize}
\item \(f(x)=0\)
\item \(f(x)=x+1\)
\item Converting natural numbers to integers
\end{itemize}
