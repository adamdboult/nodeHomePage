\subsection{Residual blocks}

In a node we have:

\(a_{ij}=\sigma_{ij}(W_{ij}a_{i-1})\)

That is, the value of a node, is the activation on the sum of the weights of the previous layer.

Residual block however look further back that one layer. They include the full data from an older layer (without weights)

\(a_{ij}=\sigma_{ij}(W_{ij}a_{i-1}+a_k)\)
