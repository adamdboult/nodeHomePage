\subsection{More layers allow for more complex function}

With additional hidden layers we can map more complex functions.

These allow the effective combination of logic gates.

\subsection{2 hidden layers can map highly complex functions}

With only two hidden layers we can map any function for classification, including discontinuous functions.
