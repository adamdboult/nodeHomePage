\subsection{Softplus}

\subsubsection{The function}

\(a(z)=\ln (1+e^z)\)

\subsubsection{The derivative}

Its derivative is the sigmoid function:

\(a'(z)=\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\)

\subsubsection{Notes}

The softplus function is a smooth approximation of the ReLU function.

Unlike the ReLU function, Softplus does not induce sparcity.
