\subsection{Convolutional layers}

Can connect each  node in first hidden layer to a subset of the input layer, eg one node for each 5x5 pixels

We also share weights for each of the first layer. Much fewer parameters, and can learn all good stuff

This also uses windows. Instead of max we multiply the window by a matrix elementwise and sum the values

Each matrix can represent some feature, like a curve.

We can use multiply convolution matrices to create multiple output matrices.

Matrices are called kernels. they are trained. start off random
