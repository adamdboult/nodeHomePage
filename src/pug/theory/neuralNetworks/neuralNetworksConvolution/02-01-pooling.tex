\subsection{Pooling layers}

The input is a matrix. We place a number of windows on the input matrix. The max of each window is an input to the next layer.

Means fewer parameters, easier to compute, less chance of overfitting

Parameters: height, width of window, stride (amount shifts by each window)

We can also add padding to the edge of the image so we don't lose data.

Same padding (use 0), valid padding (no padding)

Pooling layer compresses, takes 2x2. Max pooling returns highest activiation
