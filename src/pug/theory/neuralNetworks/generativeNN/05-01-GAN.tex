\subsection{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection{The GAN generator}

Generator: take latent multivar normal as input layer

Output of generator is of same dimension as input iamges

Generative NN: need probability distribution on input layer

Generator typically deconvolutional

Downside of gan. only discriminates between real and fake.

\subsubsection{The GAN discriminator}

Discriminator: use normal CNN for deep
