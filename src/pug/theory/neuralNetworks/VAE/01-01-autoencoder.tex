\subsection{Autoencoders}

Autoencoders are a type of neural network.

For autoencoders the goal for the output layer is the reconstructed input layer, rather than a classification.

By including sparsity in the neural network we can reduce the dimensions. This splits the network into an encoder and a decoder.

Middle vector is called latent variables.
