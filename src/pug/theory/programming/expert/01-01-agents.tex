Forward and backward chaining

Has a knowledge base (domain specific content)

Has an inference mechanism (domain independent algorithms)

If we want to find out whether the knowledge base implies a statement, we can check using semantics or sytax.

Inference is similar to search. We start with the knowledge base. We can apply the inference rule to all statements which match the top line of modus ponens (or another rule).

The actions are inference rules. We add new sentences to the b

Agents can also interact with the world in order to add to the knowledge base

Convert each item in knowledge base to CNF for resolution rule.
