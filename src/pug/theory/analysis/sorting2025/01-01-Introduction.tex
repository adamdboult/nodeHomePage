\subsection{Introduction}

multivariate functions rename to multivariate space? Move elsewhere? Later h3 at least, in line integrals, metrics etc

more on trig to own h3 after integration
	tangent to there
	trig identities of integration there

mutlivar integral of scalar field to own h3, relies on metrics

After grad of vector. Show is conservative. Definition of conservative field, link to curl?

Helmholtz. All vector fields can be decomposed to one with div 0 and one with curl 0
Laplace equation
Helmholtz equation
Poissons equation

optimisation univariate has hessian - belongs in multivar

page on separation of variables to solve
page on lie group method

Curl of any vector field has divergence 0
