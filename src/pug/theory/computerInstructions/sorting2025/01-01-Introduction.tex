\subsection{Introduction}

Data (SIMD) (RV64IMFDQV\_Ziscr\_Zifencei) and Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) (computerInstructions)
int ALU: multiplier-accumulator (MAC)
+ does this belong in mult section or not?
+ i think this is part of P, not part of standard multiply anyway

rv32im
with multiplication and division

rv32imf
with float

floating ALU: fused multiply-add (FMA)
+ system on a chip
+ SSE/AVX
+ Microcode


on floating, include RV64IMF
