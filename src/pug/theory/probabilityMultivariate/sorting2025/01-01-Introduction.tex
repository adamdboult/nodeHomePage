rearrange:
+ unsupervised after exploratory
+ generative after unsupervised
+ anova in exploratory

stats: Variable Inflation Factors. avoiding multiple colinariy

statistical modelling
+ rubin causal (problem: don't observe counterfactual, try to compensate)
+ vs pearl directed acyclical graphs

data cleaning split out
+ shaping/joining
