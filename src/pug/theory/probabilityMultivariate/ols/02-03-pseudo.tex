\subsection{The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse}

For a matrix \(X\), the pseudoinverse is \((X^*X)^{-1}X^*\).

For real matrices, this is: \((X^TX)^{-1}X^T\)

The pseudoinverse can be written as \(X^+\)

Therefore \(\theta \) is the pseudoinverse of the inputs, multiplied by the outputs. Or:

\(\theta = X^+y\)

The pseudoinverse satisfies:

\(XX^+X=X\)

\(X^+XX^+=X^+\)
