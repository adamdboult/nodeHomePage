\subsection{Bagging}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Bagging, or Bootstrap AGGregation, is a way of generating weak learners.

\subsubsection{Bootstrapping}

Bootstraping refers to taking samples with repacement from the training set. This is how the datasets for each of the weak learners are formed.	

\subsubsection{How to do bagging}

We take samples from the training set, with replacement, and train each of these separately. This gives us our weak learners.
