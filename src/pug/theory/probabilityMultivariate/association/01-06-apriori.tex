\subsubsection{Finding frequent patterns}

We can use search algorithms to find frequent patterns. Starting at the empty set.

\subsubsection{Apriori algorithm}

Breadth first search to generate candidate set of itemsets with support above some value.

Start with a \(1\)-itemset, and increase \(k\) once done.

Once we have found a frequent pattern, we can immediately identify other frequent patterns associated with it.

We can do this by looking at confidence, not support.
