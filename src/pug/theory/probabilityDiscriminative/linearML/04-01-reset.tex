\subsection{The Ramsey RESET test}

The Ramsey Regression Equation Specification Error Test (RESET)

Once we have done our OLS we have \(\hat y\).

The Ramsey RESET test is an additional stage, which takes these predictions and estimates:

\(y=\theta x+\sum_{i=1}^3\alpha_i \hat {y^i}\)

We then run an F-test on \(\alpha\), with the null that \(\alpha = 0\).
