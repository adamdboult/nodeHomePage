\subsection{Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

With LASSO we add a constraint to \(\hat \theta \).

\(\sum_i \hat \theta_i \le t\)

Regularisation of LLS. Sum of thetas are constrained to be below hyperparameter \(t\)

L1 regularisation

This is also known as sparce regression, because many weights are set to \(0\).

This now looks like:

\(w_{lasso} = \arg \min ||y-Xw||^2_2+\lambda ||w||_1\)

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter}

\(t\) is a hyperparameter.
