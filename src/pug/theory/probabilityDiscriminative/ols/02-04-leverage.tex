\subsection{Leverage}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Leverage measures how much the predicted value of \(y_i\), \(\hat y_i\), changes as \(y_i\) changes.

We have:

\(\mathbf y = \mathbf X \theta +\mathbf u\)

\(\hat \theta =X(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\)

\(\hat \theta =P_Xy\)

The leverage score is defined as:

\(h_i=P_{ii}\)
