\subsection{Predictions}

Our data \((\mathbf y, \mathbf X)\) is divided into \((y_i, \mathbf x_i)\).

We create a function \(\hat y_i = f(\mathbf x_i)\).

The best predictor of \(y\) given \(x\) is:

\(g(X)=E[Y|X]\)

The goal of regression is to find an approximation of this function.

\subsection{Residuals}

\(\epsilon_i = y_i- \hat y_i\)

\subsection{Residual sum of squares (RSS)}

\(RSS=\sum_i \epsilon_i^2\)

\(RSS=\sum_i (y_i-\hat y_i)^2\)

\subsection{Explained sum of squares (ESS)}

\(ESS=\sum_i (\bar y-\hat y_i)^2\)

\subsection{Total sum of squares (TSS)}

\(TSS=\sum_i (y_i-\bar y)^2\)

\subsection{Relationship between prediction and probability distribution}

\(P(y|X, \theta )\)

\(\hat y =f(\mathbf x)\)

Through integration?

\(E[y] = \int P(y|X, \theta ) dy\)
