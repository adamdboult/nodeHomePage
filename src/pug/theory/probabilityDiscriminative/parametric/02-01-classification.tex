\subsection{Binary classification}

Classification models are a type of regression model, where \(y\) is discrete rather than continuous.

So we want to find a mapping from a vector \(X\) to probabilities across discrete \(y\) values.

A classifier takes \(X\) and returns a vector.

For a classifier we have \(K\) classes. 


\subsection{Classification}

Confusion matrix. true positve, false positive, false negative, true negative

Can use this to get

Accuracy: percentage correct

Precision: percentage of positive predictions which are correct

Recall (sensitivity): percentage of poitive cases that were predicted as positive

Specificity: percentage of negative cases preicated as negative
