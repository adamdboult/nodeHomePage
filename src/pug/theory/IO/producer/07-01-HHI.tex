\subsection{Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)}

The index is the sum of each firm’s market share squared.

For a monopolist this is \(1\), for a completely competitive market it is \(0\), or \(\dfrac{1}{n}\).

\(H=\sum_{i=1}^ns^2_i\)

If this is just done with the largest firms, the results will be similar to the result for the whole market, due to the quadratic element.

To normalise this between \(0\) and \(1\) we can use:

\(H*=\dfrac{H-\dfrac{1}{n}}{1-\dfrac{1}{n}}\)
