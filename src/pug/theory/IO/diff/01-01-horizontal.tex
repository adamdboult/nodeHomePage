\subsection{Horizontal competition}

Assured and contestable demand

So buyer wants 100 from incumbent, and 50 more. 

First 100 are assured. 50 are  contestable.

Cournot, bertrand mean entrant gets something

However rebates from incumbant blocks entrant.

eg reduce unit price for all if sales above certain amount
