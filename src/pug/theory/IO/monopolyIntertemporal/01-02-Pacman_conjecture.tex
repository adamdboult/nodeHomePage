\subsection{The Pacman conjecture}

Related to Coase conjecture but opposite conclusion.

Monopolist can initially set prices at highest level then slowly lower them, eating total surplus (hence "pacman").

Relies on infinite time horizon.

Both Coase conjecture and Pacman conjecture are in the contetx of durable goods.
