\subsection{Recap}

In the multinomial logit model we had:

\(P_{ij}=\dfrac{e^{\Theta z_j}}{1+\sum_{k=1} e^{\Theta z_k }}\)

\subsection{Adding customer characteristics}

If \(z_j\) just includes product characteristics then we have homogeneous preferences.

We can include customer level data in \(z_j\), for example individual income, location, age etc.

\subsection{Estimation}

As before, we want product characteristics and prices.

However rather than market share we instead use customer level  information.
