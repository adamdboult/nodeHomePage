\subsection{Dummy variables for products}

By adding a dummy for each product we control for unobserved variables.
This adds a parameter for each product, which can increase the variance of the estimates.
Adding the dummies affects the other estimators. We can fix this using minimum distance estimator.
The error no longer includes unobserved characteristics.

Dummies for groups. These create fewer new parameters.
