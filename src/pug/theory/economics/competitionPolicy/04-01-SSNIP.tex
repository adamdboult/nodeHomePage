\subsection{SSNIP test}

Small but significant and non-transitory increase in price

Would this cause customers to move elsewhere?

If we have demand at different prices we can estimate whether it is worth monopolising the market.

Because this lack of motivation may be because of competitor goods, we can include these to see if that market is worth monopolising.

For example: hiking up the price of one good may not be profitable. Therefore that is not a relevant market (though it could be!). Then we can see if hiking up the price of that good, and others, is profitable. If so, then it is a relevant market.

Note:

High elasticity may be because monopoly power is already being exerted

Identify smallest market where a monopolist could increas price profitably

How to do test? interview customers about whether increase in price would negatively affect them. want to know if they could switch.

If could switch at price rise of say 5%, then market is too small to "be worth monopolising". choose larger

Can be used to estimate elasticity of demand

We can also look at the cost impact from cutting units. if high variable, then more appealing

We can expand to include substitutes. if substitutes make worth monopolisign, then merger can be concerning.
