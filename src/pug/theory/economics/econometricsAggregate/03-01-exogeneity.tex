\subsection{Using IVs}

Let's say the demand function is:

\(Q_d=\alpha+\beta P + \epsilon \)

How can we estimate this?

OLS will give biased results if \(P\) is correlated with \(\epsilon \).

We can estimate if we have an instrumental variable for \(P\). 

\subsection{Power of IVs}

need variation. if factor v important, little price movelemtn. may be hard to esimate that fact.
