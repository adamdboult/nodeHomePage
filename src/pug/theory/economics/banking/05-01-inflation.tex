\subsection{Real effects of inflation}

If there is unexpected change in money supply, prices will eventually need to update. This could happen immediately, with all prices doubling following a discovery of shells, for example. This would not affect any real (relative) prices.

If, however, some prices are slow to adjust, then their relative prices will change. This would result in prices no longer clearing. If the nominal price of fish is sticky and, prior to inflation, the supply of fish equalled demand for fish, then the inflation would cause the relative price to fall. This would mean that more was demanded than supplied, and output fell.

Price and wage rigidity varies across countries.

\subsection{Borrowers and savers}

If Alice owes Bob 10 shells, and there is a surprise increase in inflation, then Alice is better off and Bob worse off. Expected inflation, or debts in real terms, does not have this issue.
