\subsection{Savings}

Alice starts cutting back on meat to save shells for the future. This gives Bob a dilemma; he has less income so he can either:

\begin{itemize}
\item Continue spending, drawing down on his shells; or
\item Spend less (for simplicity, on fish).
\end{itemize}

In the first case Alice’s savings are equal to Bob’s “borrowing”, and net saving is zero. In the second case, Alice can’t get the extra shells to save, because Bob is not buying her fish. Net savings are also zero.

This is cash saving. In the real world total savings can be above zero because of stockpiling and investment.
