What does it mean eg to be 8 bit register machine?

How did 8 bit computers have more than \(2^8\) bits of memory (32 bytes).
In part pointer points to start of word/byte so can point to \(2^8\) words/bytes etc .

Can refer to memory addresses using \(\$FF\) if 8 bit \((16*16=2^8)\).


Can refer to memory addresses using \(\$FFFF\) if 16 bit \((16^4 = 2^16)\).
