\subsection{Words}

Words (size of register on a pc. eg 8 bits on 8bit, 64 bit on 64 bit)

What does it mean eg to be 8 bit register machine?

16-bit means registers have 16 bits. Can cover \(0\) to \(65535\).

8-bit means registers have 8 bits. Can cover \(0\) to \(255\).

Each possible value in an address register can refer to a unique word in memory.

\subsection{Bytes and nibbles}

Bytes (8 bit by standard)

Nibbles (4 bit)

\subsection{How much memory can be accessed by registers}

For an \(n\)-bit register there can be \(2^n\) possible values, and this can cover \(n*2^n\) bits of data, because each word stores \(n\) bits.

For a \(8\)-bit register this means \(8*2^8=2048\) bits, or \(256\) bytes.

For a \(16\)-bit register this means \(16*2^16=1048576\) bits, or \(65536\) bytes.

\subsection{Using hexidecimal to refer to memory addresses}

Can refer to memory addresses using \(\$FF\) if 8-bit \((16*16=2^8)\).

Can refer to memory addresses using \(\$FFFF\) if 16-bit \((16^4=2^16)\).

\subsection{Memory extension beyond \(2^16\) bytes. Memory segmentation}

\subsection{Other}

Bit arrays

Bit fields (special use cases for bit arrays? bit arrays more fundamental. bit field more like "we can use first bit for checking if zero"
