\subsection{Pointers}
Getting address of variable with \&


variable pointers with \& and * in c

\begin{verbatim}
int a = 1;
int * b = &a;
\end{verbatim}
\(\*p\) assumes \(p\) is pointer and gets what it points at. \(\&p\) assumes \(p\) is value and gets address of \(p\).


\(NULL\) is literal pointer to no valid data. same as \(0\).

pointer of zero doesn't work, reserved

\subsection{Dangling pointers}

\begin{verbatim}
int * p = NULL;
{
	int a = 1;
	p = &a;
}
\end{verbatim}

\(p\) is dangling after because scope ends.
