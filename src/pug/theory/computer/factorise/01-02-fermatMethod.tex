\subsection{Fermat's method}

Identify the integer as the difference of two squares, and use this.

\(x=a.b\)

We use the midpoint of the two as \(c=\dfrac{a+b}{2}\)

This only works for odd numbers. If we have

The we have:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(a=c+d\)
\item \(b=c-d\)
\item \(x=(c+d)(c-d)\)
\item \(x=c^2-d^2\)
\end{itemize}

We can test this by trying \(a\) to get \(a^2-x\), and seeing if this is a square number.
