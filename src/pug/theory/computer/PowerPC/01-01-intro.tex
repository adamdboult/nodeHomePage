\subsection{Introduction}

li r3, 4 (move 4 into register 3)

r0 is always zero

r1 is stack pointer

r3 is return value

\subsection{Arithmetic}
add r1, r2, r3 (add r2 and r3 and put in r1)

addi r1, r2, 3 (add r2 and immediate value of 3 and put in r1)

can do "move" by adding zero to something and putting it in destination

\subsection{Branching}
b label (branch to label)

cmp 0, 0, r1, r2 (compare two values into condition register 0)

blt label (go to branch if previous comparison was less than)
ble
beq
bge
bgt
bne

\subsection{RAM}

accessing RAM
stw r1, 8(r2) (store r1 in location indicated by r2 offset by 8)
lwz r1, 8(r2) (replace r1 with data in location indicated by r2 offset by 8)

\subsection{Functions}

functions:
bl label (branch and link - saves return address in link register)
blr (branch to link register - ending a function)

\subsection{Floating point}
floating point
f0, f1, etc are floating point registers
lfs (load float single)
lfd
stfs
stfd (store float dobule)

fadd (floating add)
fadds (floating add single precision)
fmul
fmadd
fdiv
