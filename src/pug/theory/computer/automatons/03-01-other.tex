\subsection{Branching}

testing for if branches and with target

\subsection{Instructions}
starting cycle. read next instruction pointer. read that instruction. read additional bytes needed. do instruction. wait clock cycles

cpu instructions can vary by required clocks
cpu instructions have addressing modeds. they also take addresses. defined address length?

cpu has status register. series of bits about status
last instruction etc
\subsection{Addresses}
can address using page and offset. two hex for each.
can write eg 0x00FF. last byte of irst page
