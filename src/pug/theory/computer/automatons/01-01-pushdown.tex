\subsection{Pushdown automatons}

In a finite-state machine the action of the machine depends on the state, and on the input. In a pushdown automaton it also depends on a third input â€“ stack.

The stack is a list of symbols. It is the first item on the stack which is used to inform the decision.

The actions of a machine in finite-state machine were to move from state to state. In a pushdown automaton, the actions can also affect the stack, and therefore future changes in state.

A pushdown automaton uses a Last-in First-out (LiFo) stack.
