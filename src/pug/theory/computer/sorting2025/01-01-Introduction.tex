\subsection{Introduction}

curry howard correspondence
+ relation between programs and mathematical proof
+ related to lambda calculus and combinatory logic

instructions are stored in finite state machine if no external instructions. this means for any given finite constraint, there are integrers that cannot be represented. however for any program, there is a finite state machine that could hold it.

turing jump
+ jumps in difficulty of solving decision problems

comp sci:
+ simulating a 2 directional turing machine with 1 direction
+ simulating an n color turing machine with 2 colors

Integer programming on comp sci

comp sci basics:
+ When introducing external memory, concept of "load store". ALU only on registers.

\subsection{ARM Basics}
rename to RISC V basics

rv32i
32 bit, add and subtract integers
rv64i
64 bit

What registers does RV64I have?:
+ stack pointer; link register, others?
\subsection{Stack machines}
stack register
+ is there a diffrence between stack counter and stack register? (reflect on the page which implements in register machine)
+ no, different names for same thing
