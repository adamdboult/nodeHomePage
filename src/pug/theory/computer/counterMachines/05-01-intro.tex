\subsection{Simulating a Turing machine with a counter machine}

We know from earlier that a \(2\) stack machine is equivalent to Turing machine.

A stack can be simulated with \(2\) counters, therefore a \(4\) counter machine can simulate a Turing machine.

\(4\) counters can be simulated by \(2\) counters, and therefore a machine with just \(2\) counters is Turing equivalent.
