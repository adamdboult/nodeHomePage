\subsection{Representing natural numbers}

We will use a byte to describe natural numbers. This gives us a range of \(2^8=256\). As we include \(0\) the largest number here is \(255\).

\subsection{Zero}

We describe zero using all \(0\)s.

\(0=00000000\)

\subsection{Hexidecimal}

4 bits

\(2^4\) is \(16\)

use \(0\) to \(15\), \(0\) to \(f\).


can represent byte with 2 hex.
\(16 x 16 = 2^8 = 256\)
\(0xFA\)
