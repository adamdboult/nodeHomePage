Eg 8 queens


\subsection{Search tree}
in search tree, each node has state which is used for test. could be ID of node (for path finding), path history and cost (for trav salesman)

frontier (not open list)

backward search. only possible if end state is clearly defined. eg maze. not clear if don't know eg 8 queens.

can do breadth first on them simultaneously?

problem has: initial state. actions, transition model

model \(T(s, a)-> s_n+1\). as in , given state and action, we have new state

goal test on each state

path cost for each sucessor

search tree. we expand when testing action.

open lists in unexplored notes.

loopy paths. if we go \(a->b\) don't need to go \(b->a\) because if goal, not any closer, if util, higher cost.

redunant paths. if we've already been to c, no need to explore going there from somewhere else in goal

if already been to c at lower cost, no point for util

actions is function on state.

keep explored states in open list
