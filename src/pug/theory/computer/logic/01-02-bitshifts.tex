\subsection{Bitshifts}

We can have other operations where bits do interact. An important operator is the bit shift. This takes a series of bits and shifts them to the right or left by one place. This pushes one bit off the end. 

The new bit can take a \(0\) or \(1\).

Logic gates are not needed for bit shifts. Instead wiring of inputs to outputs achieves the same effect.


shift left is x2
shift right is /2
