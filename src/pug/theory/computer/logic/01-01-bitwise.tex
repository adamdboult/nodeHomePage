\subsection{NOT}

We can perform basic operations on inputs.

A simple operation is the unary NOT operator, which returns the reverse of the values of all bits.

We also have binary operators, which take two bits and return another bit. Of note are, AND, OR and XOR.

These operations are a model of Boolean algebra. So there are \(16\) possible binary functions and \(4\) possible unary operators.

As in logic, we can combine elementary logical gates to create other logic gates.

These operations can also be performed on a series of bits, however each individual bit is independent of other bits for these operations.



masks in bitwise operations. take only desired part by doing and operation with mask

\subsection{Setting values}

setting values. or operator with target values if want to set to 1.
what if want to set 0? invert map and use and. or just use xor
