\subsection{Address bus}

Address bus connects to part of memory. setting the address bus to x will allow accessing ram at x.

\subsection{Data bus}

Data bus reads or writes to memory at location of address bus.

eg if loading byte of ram at position \(\#FF00\) to accumulator, address bus is \(\#FF00\).


using RAM: LDR and STR
str r0, [r1]
store value in r0 at memory location indicated by r1
ldr r0, [r1]
load value at r1 in memory to r0
ldr r0, [r1, \#4]
load value at r1 offset by 4 to r0
