		h3 on general relativity
			key problem at start: gravitational mass and interial mass differ as do shifts
			to solve need general relativity

		relativity makes electromagnetism inevitable, and general relativity inevitable
Special relativity. 4 velocity is a constant. If not moving full speed through time

Special relativity and the split between gravitational and inertial mass
