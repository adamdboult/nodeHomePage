\subsection{Autocovariance and autocorrelation}

\subsubsection{Autocovariance}

\(AC(a,b)=cov(X_a, X_b)\)

\subsubsection{Autocorrelation}

The autocorrelation between two time periods is their covariance, normlised by their variances

\(AC(a,b)=\dfrac{E[(X_a-\mu_a)(X_b-\mu_b)]}{\sigma_a \sigma_b}\)

This is also called serial correlation.
