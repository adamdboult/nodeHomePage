\subsection{Introduction}

stable diffusion split out:
+ remove noise from existing images. train model for this
+ make random images from nise
+ condition model on text
+ classifier free guidance


multimodal: text to image (stable diffusion)

multimodal: text to video??

diffusion networks (can be in NN or does it require domain specific knowledge?)

\subsection{Computer vision}
"3D reconstruction from multiple images"
h3 on images (supervised)
+ cnn/pooling
+ capsules
