\subsection{Measure space}

In a metric space, the structure was defining a value for each two elements of the set.

In a measure space, the structure defines a value of subsets of the set.

A measure space includes the set \(X\), subsets of the set, \(\Sigma \), and a function \(\mu \) which maps from \(\Sigma \) to \(\mathbb{R}\).
