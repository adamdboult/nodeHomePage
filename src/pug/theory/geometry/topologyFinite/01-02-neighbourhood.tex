\subsection{Neighbourhood topology}

We have a set \(X\).

For each element \(x\in X\), there is a non-empty set of neighbourhoods \(N\in \mathbf N(x)\) where \(x\in N\subseteq X\) such that:

\begin{itemize}
\item If \(N\) is a subset of \(M\), \(M\) is a neighbourhood.
\item The intersection of two neighbourhoods of \(x\) is a neighbourhood of \(x\).
\item \(N\) is a neighbourhood for each point in some \(M\subseteq N\)
\end{itemize}
