\subsection{The cross product}

\(v\times  u\)

\subsubsection{Cross product is a bilinear map}

This is a bilinear map from two vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) to another vector in the same space.

\(V\times V \rightarrow V\)

\subsubsection{Calculating the cross product}

This is calcualted by:

\(u\times v=||u|| ||v|| \sin(\theta )n\)

The resulting vector is perpendicular to both input vectors.
