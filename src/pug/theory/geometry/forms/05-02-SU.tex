\subsection{Special unitary groups \(SU(n, F)\)}

The special unitary group, \(SU(n,F)\), is the subgroup of \(U(n,F)\) where the determinants are \(1\).

That is, \(|M|=1\)

\subsubsection{The determinant of unitary matrices}

The determinant of the unitary matrices is:

\(\det U^*=\det U^{-1}\)

\((\det U)^*=\dfrac{1}{\det U} \)

\((\det U)^*\det U = 1 \)

\(||\det U||= 1\)
