\subsection{Exterior (Grassman) algebra}

The exterior algebra is the algebra generated by the wedge product.

The term \(u\land v\) can be interpreted as the area covered by the parallelogram generated by \(u\) and \(v\).

As \(a\mathbf u\land b\mathbf v=ab \mathbf u\land \mathbf v\), we can see that scaling the length of one of the vectors by a scalar, we also increase the exterior product by the same scalar.

\subsection{Orientation}

We can describe the exterior product of two vectors as \(\mathbf u\land \mathbf v\) or \(\mathbf v \land \mathbf u\).
