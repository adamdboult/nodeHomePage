\subsection{Fields}

A field is a ring where the multiplication function has an inverse.

The integers, addition and multiplication form a ring, but not a group.

The rational numbers (except \(0\)), addition and multiplication form a field (and a ring).

The real numbers and complex numbers also form fields.
