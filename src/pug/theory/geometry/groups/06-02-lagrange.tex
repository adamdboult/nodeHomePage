\subsection{Lagrange's theorem}

Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group \(G\), the order of every subgroup is a divisor of the order of \(G\).

Consider subset \(H\). We know that all cosets are disjoint, and that the union of all cosets is \(G\).

As cosets are the same size, we know that:

\(|G|=m|H|\), where \(m\) is the number of cosets.

This means that if a group has order \(10\), a subgroup must have order \(1\), \(2\) \(5\) or \(10\).
