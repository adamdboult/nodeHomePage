\subsection{Homomorphisms form a vector space}

If we can can show that scalars can act on morphisms, then we can shwn that morphisms on a vector space are themselves a vector space.

Scalars can act on morphisms, and so morphisms of vector spaces are themselves vector spaces.

\subsubsection{Dimensions of homomorphisms}

We can identify the dimensionality of this new vector space from the dimensions of the original vector spaces.

\(\dim (\hom(V, W))=\dim V \dim W\)
