\subsection{Singular value decomposition}

The singular value decomposition of \(m\times n\) matrix \(M\) is:

\(M=U\Sigma V^* \)

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(U\) is a unitary matrix (\(m\times m\))
\item \(\Sigma \) is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers (\(m\times n\))
\item \(V\) is a unitary matrix (\(n\times n\))
\end{itemize}

\(\Sigma \) is unique. \(U\) and \(V\) are not.

\subsubsection{Properties}

\(M^*M=U\Sigma^2 U^*\)

\((M^*M)^{-1}=V\Sigma^{-2} V^*\)

\subsubsection{Calculating the SVD}

The SVD is generally calculated iteratively.
