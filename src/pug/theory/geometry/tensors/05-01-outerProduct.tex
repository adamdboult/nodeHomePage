\subsection{Outer product}

\subsubsection{The outer product is a bilinear map}

This is a bilinear map from two vectors from the same vector space to another vector space.

\(V\times V \rightarrow V\)

\subsubsection{Calculating the outer product}

\(u\otimes v = w\)

\(w_{ij}=u_iv_j\)

\subsubsection{The dimensions of the tensor outer product}

\(\dim (V \otimes W)= \dim V \times \dim W \)

\subsubsection{Outer product on the complex numbers}

\subsubsection{Relation between the dot product and outer product}

The dot product in the trace of the outer product.
