\subsection{Dot product}

\subsubsection{Dot product is a bilinear form}

This is a bilinear form, a mapping from two vectors in the same vector space to the underlying field.

\(V\times V \rightarrow F\)

\subsubsection{Calculating the dot product}

This is calculated by multiplying each matching element, and summing the results.

\(u\cdot v =\sum_{i=1}^nu_iv_i\)

\subsubsection{Dot product on the complex numbers}

Properties don't hold. Can get zero vectors from non-zero inputs. Get complex numbers from dot product on itself.

Inner products better deal with complex number fields. However they are not bilinear maps.
