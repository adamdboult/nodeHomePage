topology;
	Banachâ€“Tarski paradox

torus is product of \(S^1 X S^1\)
can also model torus as fiber bundle
mobius strip can be modelled as finite length on a circle, which is twisted. NB base space is a circle going through the strip, not a length of one of the intersection things.

Fiber bundle Vs higher dimensional manifold
Local symmetry possible
Model functions on manifold

fibre bundle
\(E->B\)
where E is an element in the total space, and B is an element in the base space.

Topology: open cover and sub cover. Open cover is a collection of open sets which collectively include all points in S. Sub cover is subset of open xover which still covers S. Related to compactness
