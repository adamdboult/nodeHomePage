\subsection{Loops, multiple edges and simple graphs}

\subsubsection{Loops}

A loop is an edge where both the vertices are the same.

\subsubsection{Multiple edges}

If there are two edges with the same pair of indices, there are multiple edges.

\subsubsection{Simple graphs}

No loops or multiple edges.
