\subsection{Compact spaces}

A space \(X\) is compact if each open cover has a finite subcover.

If we can define a cover which does not have a finite subcover, then the space is not compact.

For example an infinite cover could be tend towards \((0,1)\), eg as \(\dfrac{1}{n},1-\dfrac{1}{n}\)

This covers \((0,1)\), but there is no finite subcover. As a result \((0,1)\) is not compact.
