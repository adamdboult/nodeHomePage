\subsection{Introduction}

Instruction level parallelism in that page. How much a program can be parallelised
simulatneous multithreading as concept relaed to superscalar CPUs (multiple execution units)

c parallel

\begin{verbatim}
#include <pthread.h>
pthread\_t threads[2];

// start
pthread\_create(&threads[0], NULL, myFun, (void *) &thread\_args);
// block until thread finished
pthread\_join(threads[0], NULL);
\end{verbatim}

% map reduce
% race conditions
% multi threading
% thread safety. mutex. semaphore. locks.
% futures and promises

in big page on parallel stuff, h3 on linear algebra
on parallel: hyperthreading
