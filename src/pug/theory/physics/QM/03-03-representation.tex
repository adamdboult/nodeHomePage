\subsection{Representation theory for the time group}

Time is a linear operator

Instead, we describe the time operator as a Lie group, using Lie algebra.

\(\Psi (t_b-t_a)=e^{(t_b-t_a)X}\)

\subsubsection{States are vectors}

We can remove a degree of freedom by using norm of 1 for vectors

For each dynamic system we define a set of possible states.

We can describe a state \(v\in V\).

\subsubsection{Finite state spaces}

We can describe a system like heads or tails.

\subsubsection{Infinite state spaces}

This can describe continous position, or an angle.
