\subsection{Sample mean}

We previously defined the population mean is defined as \(\mu=E[X]\).

The sample mean is defined as \(\bar x = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i\).

\subsubsection{Centred mean}

We can subtract the mean from each entry in the sample. This will leave a new mean of \(0\). This is convenient for many calculations.
