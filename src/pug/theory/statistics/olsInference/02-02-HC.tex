\subsection{Heteroskedasticity-Consistent (HC) standard errors}

\subsubsection{Variance of OLS estimators}

\(Var [\hat \theta ]=(X^TX)^{-1}X^T\Omega X(X^TX)^{-1}\)

\subsubsection{Robust standard errors for heteroskedasticity}

\(\Omega_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\epsilon_i\epsilon_j\)

These are also known as the Eicker-Huber-White standard errors, or the White correction.

These are also refered to as robust standard errors.
