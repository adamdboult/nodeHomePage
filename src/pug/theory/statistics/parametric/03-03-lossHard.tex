\subsection{Loss functions for hard classifiers}

Don't want answers outside \(0\) and \(1\).

\subsubsection{F score}

\subsubsection{F1 score}

\(F_1\) score: \(\dfrac{2PR}{(P+R)}\)

may not just care about accuracy, eg breast cancer screening

high accurancy can result from v basic model (ie all died on titanic)

\subsubsection{Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC)}
