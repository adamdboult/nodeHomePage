\subsection{Classic regression trees}

In a classical regression tree, we follow a decison process as before, but the outcome is real number.

Within each leaf, all inputs are assigned that same number.

\subsubsection{Training}

With a regression problem we cannot split nodes the same way as we did for classification.

Instead by split by the residual sum of squares.
