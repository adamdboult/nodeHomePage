\subsection{Z-test for variable significance}

\subsubsection{The standard score}

We may want to see how different a mean statistic is from a specific value.

The standard score allows us to measure this, by taking this distance and standardising by the standard deviation.

\(z=\dfrac{\bar x-x_0}{\sigma }\)

This requires us to know the standard deviation, which is in general not known.

If the sample size is large, we know this converges to the normal distribution through the central limit theorem.

\subsubsection{The Z-test}

We can see how likely our statistic was to be produced if it was drawn from a normal distribution with mean \(x_0\) and standard deviation \(s_0\).

\subsubsection{P-values}

This is the chance of the statistic being produced by chance.
