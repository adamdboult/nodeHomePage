\subsection{Polynomial-time Turing reduction (the Cook reduction)}

Solve using polynomial number of calls to another problem, and polynomial amount of time outside that.

\subsection{Many-one reduction}

Special case of the Cook reduction. Transform input of one problem to input of another, where answers are the same.

Transformation of inputs must be done in polynomial.

\subsection{Truth table reduction}

Another special case of the Cook reduction. 

Transforms inputs into a number of other inputs to a different problem. Result is a function of the outputs of the other problem.
