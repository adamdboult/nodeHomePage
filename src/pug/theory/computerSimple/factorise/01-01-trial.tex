\subsection{Trial division}

We have x

Divide by numbers between 2 and x

Only need to go to sqrt x

Don't need to divide by even numbers other than 2


algorithm for checking if number is a prime

loop up dividing number from 2

if divides, add factor list and divide target number by that

stop when i reaches number

eg for 45

divide 2? no

divide 3? yes :> 15

divide 3? yes :> 5

divide 4? no

divide 5? yes :> 1

6>1 so stop

number is prime if list just contains target

don't have to worry about including non primes in list, as will already have divded by that amount
