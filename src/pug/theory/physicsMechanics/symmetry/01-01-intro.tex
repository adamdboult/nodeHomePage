\subsection{Symmetry}
We have a system of particles or something. we can do a measure on it.

We can do functions on the system.

What is preserved is an invariant measure


We observe event, worldline. other observers can:

\subsection{Rotations}

\subsection{Translations}

\subsection{Boosts}
Part here on adding velocities. show classical limit of normal adding them.
