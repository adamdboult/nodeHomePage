\subsection{Pure tones}

Describe a pitch by vibration
frequency Hertz Hz, period

octave up is 2x frequency

phenomenon of finding similarity betwenn octaves, so can be named similarly.

Musical interval
2:1 - octave
1:1 - unison


consonance and dissonance
phenomena of whether we see pitches as in harmony or not

how to create notes between?
equal temperament:
want [n] number, so each ratio is \(2^{1/n}\)

for 12 tone scale, \(2^{1/12}\)

harmonic of a tone
take tone. integer multiples of the frequencies are the harmonic sequence.
frequencies here are "rational"
frequences of equal temperament are irrational (between octaves)

pythagorean scale
generated by pure 5ths (3:2)(aka perfect fifth)  and octaves (2:1)
result is unevenly spaced notes

\subsection{Chords}

major chord: root, major third, perfect fifth
minor chord: root, minor third, perfect fifth

Ohm's acoustic law: we can hear individual notes when put together
