\subsection{Policies}

The decision maker needs to decide which action to take. For a MDP we assume that the agent knows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The current state
\item The transition matrix
\item The payoffs
\end{itemize}

If the current state is not known, we have a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.

If the transition matrix or payoffs are not known we have a reinforcement learning problem.
