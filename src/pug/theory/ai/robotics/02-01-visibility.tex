\subsection{Visibility graphs}

Visibility graph generates nodes from points on obstacles, current position and goal. generate graph.

Use A* to solve

That algorithm is called VGRAPH

\subsection{Robots with volume}

What if robot takes up space?

Expand each obstacle by size of robot

How to grow each obstacle? draw shape of robot around each obstacle. shape is relative to point, so the growth is asymmetric if you choose a point for the robot which is not in the middle. eg a vertex.

\subsection{Rotation of robots}

What about rotation? grow robot by shape of all rotations. but this is overly conservative. will miss paths

Can do vgraph for each rotation, and switch between rotations. can choose 2 or 3 rotations
