\subsection{Voronoi path planning}

Find paths as far as way from obstacles as possible

Divide plane in cells, with a cell around each obstacle

Within a cell, all points are closest to that obstacle

We move along the lines between cells

Overly conservative

Hard to compute in 3d

Small environmental changes can significantly change the graph.
