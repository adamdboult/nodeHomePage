\subsection{Potential fields}

Attracted to goal, repelled from obstacle.

Goal has 0 potential energy

Can use gradient descent to get to goal

Problem of local minimums

If in a local minimum, can pertube by walking in a random direction to get out of it.

Can use laser, sonar, to detect obstacles and get potential
