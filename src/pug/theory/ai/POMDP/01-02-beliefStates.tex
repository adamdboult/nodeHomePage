\subsection{Belief states}

Inc initial knowledge of environment, page on storing observations


eg if position is right or left, at start belief state is both, if we try to move right, we are definitely right.

what if actions differ between states? can consider only actions available to all states if cost of illegal action is high

goal test: need to test all belief states
