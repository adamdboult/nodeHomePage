\subsection{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

In search tree, each node has wins/total.

So start with just root in 0/0.

Algo:

\begin{itemize}
\item Start at root
\item Take n choices to arrive at node which has not been explored (or until w/l state)
\item play randomly from there
\item Back prob up (eg if win, then 1/1 for path back to root, or 0/1 if loss)
\end{itemize}

Wins/simulation count

So deterministic when choosing paths, up until play randomly.
