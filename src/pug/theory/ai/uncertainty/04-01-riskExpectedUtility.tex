\subsection{Expected utility}

If an agent faces an uncertain world they can make decisions under uncertainty. For example, how would an agent value £10 relative to a 50% chance of £0 and a 50% chance of £20?

There are many different attitudes an agent could have – we need a form which can capture these. A standard approach is expected utility.

We start by taking 

\(E[u(x)]=\)

Subjective expected utility
