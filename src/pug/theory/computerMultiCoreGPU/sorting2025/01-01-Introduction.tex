\subsection{Introduction}

big page, maybe in compiled or parallel specific stuff. cuda, opencl, cuBLAS, rocBLAS. actually probably want to separate stuff in base headered c and related, and GPU stuff.
standard portable intermediate representation (SPIR) used in vulk and opencl
ROCm Radeon Open Compute platforM
oneAPI. open standard for GPUs, ai accelerators etc
"and cuda" in big title of the gpu stuff
opencl and sycl. same big page as cuda.
+ integrated graphics
gpu memory
nvidia: nvidia-smi program




Instruction level parallelism in that page. How much a program can be parallelised
simulatneous multithreading as concept relaed to superscalar CPUs (multiple execution units)

c parallel

\begin{verbatim}
#include <pthread.h>
pthread\_t threads[2];

// start
pthread\_create(&threads[0], NULL, myFun, (void *) &thread\_args);
// block until thread finished
pthread\_join(threads[0], NULL);
\end{verbatim}

% map reduce
% race conditions
% multi threading
% thread safety. mutex. semaphore. locks.
% futures and promises

in big page on parallel stuff, h3 on linear algebra
on parallel: hyperthreading
