\part{Users and permissions}
% passwd(give root a password?)
%useradd, userdel[what happens to files with user as owner?], chown, su[run as different user], logout. use passwd to set passwords. sudo command, whoami. /etc/passwd is file with info on users. also /etc/shadow (which contains hash of password). /home/[user] folders. pinky/finger
%groups. usermod to add user to group. users have primary group associated with just them, usually same name. can change using usermod. groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, 777 etc. what happens to file when group deleted? chgrp. command groups shows what groups a user is in
%cont groups gpasswd to set passwords for groups. /etc/groups, /etc/gshadow
%masks for permissions. umask
%run elevated temp using setuid setgid
%prevening attacks: ulimit to prevent fork bomb[ie setting up many processes to do a denial of service attack]. ulimit also prevents excessive use of memory/cpu. stored in /etc/security/limits.conf
% Linux Security Modules and SElinux page
% /root is root home directory
% /sbin for binaries only root can run
% /usr/bin and /usr/sbin    for binaries for all users. not aimed for use by system admin?. /usr generally read only stuff
% /var more write only?
