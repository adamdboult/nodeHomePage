%Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)

%Main ones
%IBM System/360
%Motorola 6800
%Motorola 68000
%Zilog Z80 (gameboy based on this, ppu separate). based on intel 8080
%Intel 8086 (x86)

%printk (print in kernel world, different to printf in user world)
%lsmod to list kernel modules
%insmod to insert kernel module
% dmesg to see kernel messages
% module_init() and module_exit() to specify functions to run when module loaded and unloaded
% #include <linux/module.h> to use module_init() and module_exit()
% #include <linux/init.h> to use __init and __exit
% #include <linux/fs.h> to use file_operations struct

% /boot ?
% /boot/vmlinuz-... (kernel)

\part{Linux file systems}
%doing before devices because file systems can be just in RAM - no devices. eg linux distros which just load from flash drive

% trailing & and nohup somewhere?
% comm and sort somewhere

\part{Devices}
% /dev folder. /dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/random.  % inc /dev/random, /dev/urandom, security risks (because pseudo)

% character devices
% block devices
\include{basicShell}
\include{keyboardLocales}

\part{Users and permissions}
% passwd(give root a password?)
%useradd, userdel[what happens to files with user as owner?],logout. use passwd to set passwords. whoami. /etc/passwd is file with info on users. also /etc/shadow (which contains hash of password). pinky
%chown, su[run as different user], sudo command, pinky/finger
% /root is root home directory. /home/[user] folders. 
% /sbin for binaries only root can run
% /usr/bin and /usr/sbin    for binaries for all users. not aimed for use by system admin?.
%\include{users}
%groups. usermod to add user to group. users have primary group associated with just them, usually same name. can change using usermod. groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, 777 etc. what happens to file when group deleted? chgrp. command groups shows what groups a user is in
%cont groups gpasswd to set passwords for groups. /etc/groups, /etc/gshadow
%masks for permissions. umask
%run elevated temp using setuid setgid
%\include{groups}

%prevening attacks: ulimit to prevent fork bomb[ie setting up many processes to do a denial of service attack]. ulimit also prevents excessive use of memory/cpu. stored in /etc/security/limits.conf
% Linux Security Modules and SElinux page
%/usr generally read only stuff
% /var more write only?

% apt exists as alternative to apt-get and apt-cache. front end for it, somewhat more user friendly
