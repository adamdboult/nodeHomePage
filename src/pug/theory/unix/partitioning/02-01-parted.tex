\subsection{parted}

partitioning using parted:

\begin{itemize}
  \item supports MBR and GPT
  \item different to fdisk? needed if drives over 2TB?
  \item parted -l (list things in /dev/) (or can use lsblk)
  \item parted /dev/sda (or whatever correct device is)
  \item this opens dialogue:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item see status with "print"
    \item type "quit" when done
    \item make gpt using "mklabel gpt"
    \item make mbr using "mklabel msdos"
    \item make partitions: "mkpart". is interactive
    \item make one bootable? "set <partition> boot on"
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
