\subsection{Garbage management of files}

The link count is stored per file. If there are zero links to a file then the file system manager knows that the file can be deleted.

\subsection{inodes}

Bad blocks are noted in inode1.

Root is inode 2.

inode 0 is null.


Within a partition, each file or folder has a unique inode.

Each partition divided into blocks. numbered from 0. Blocks are the minimum size for readable or writable operations. Changing a block means needing to read the whole block, making a change and then rewriting the block.

Files can be stored across many blocks. Block don't have to be next to each other.

Because a block is the mimimum size of any operation, there can only be one file per block, and each file takes up at least one block.

File names are the property of folders.
