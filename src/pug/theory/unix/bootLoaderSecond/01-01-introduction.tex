\subsection{Introduction}

The first-stage bootloader, eg BIOS, looks for a second-stage bootloader to load on a disk.

The second-stage bootloader loads the linux kernel then runs "init".

\subsection{GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB)}

GRUB is a second-stage bootloader.

If the drive is partitioned using MBR, it is stored in the MBR.

With BIOS and GPT, there needs to be a separate boot partition for it.
With UEFI and GPT, it can sit in the EFI partition.
