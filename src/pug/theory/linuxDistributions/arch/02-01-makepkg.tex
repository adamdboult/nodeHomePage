\subsection{Getting the build instructions}

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/apache.git
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{makepkg}

From the folder with the PKGBUILD, can run makepkg

/etc/makepkg.conf

makepkg -si to sync dependencies and install

Running "pacman -syu" will replace these packages with the repository ones. The PKGBUILD file can be amended to prevent that.
