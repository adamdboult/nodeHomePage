\subsection{Introduction}

Can pull from AUR.
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/gzdoom.git
\end{verbatim}

And then build as before.

As these packages are not in the official repositories, running pacman -Syu will not replace them.

Packages can be updated by pulling the git repo and rerunning makepkg as before.

Can see explicitly installed non-pacman using
\begin{verbatim}
pacman -Qm
\end{verbatim}
