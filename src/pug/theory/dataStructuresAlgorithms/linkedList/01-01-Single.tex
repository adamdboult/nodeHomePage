\subsection{Single linked lists}

A linked list is a collection of nodes. Each with a value and a pointer to the next element in the list.

If the element is the last in the linked list, the pointer is a null pointer.

The first item is the "head".

\subsection{Traversing the linked list}

Start at the head, and then get the pointer, go to that location and continue.

\subsection{Advantages and disadvantages of linked lists over arrays}

Advantages of linked lists include:
+ Can insert into the list without moving other elements, just changing the pointers.
+ Can add to the end of a list without needed the next physical space to be available.


Disadvantages of linked lists include:
+ Takes time (\(O(n)\)) to traverse.
+ Pointers take up memory.
