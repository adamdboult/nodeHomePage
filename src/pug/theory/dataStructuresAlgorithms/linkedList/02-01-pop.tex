\subsection{Inserting to and removing from linked lists}

An element can be inserted into a linked list by changing the pointer prior to the element to the element, and setting the pointer for the new element to what would have previously been the next element.

An element can be removed by setting the pointer for the prior element to the element after the one being removed. Note that this means the "deleted" data still exists, it is just not available in the list.
