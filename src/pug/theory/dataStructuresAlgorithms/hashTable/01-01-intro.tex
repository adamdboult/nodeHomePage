\subsection{Hash functions}

map from key to array offset

\subsection{Hash collisions}


\subsection{Resolving hash collisions with separate chaining}

rather than return offset for array, returns pointer for linked list. items in linked list contain key, so if not correct one can go to next in list

\subsection{Resolving hash collisions with open addressing}

Store the key in the bucket. If the key doesn't match the bucket keep going down until you find it. This can also be used to insert.

\subsection{Load factor of hash tables}

Number of entries over number of possible entries.

Performance deteriorates as load factor increases. can be rehashed with more possible entries.
