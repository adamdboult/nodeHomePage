\subsection{Principle of explosion}

If axioms contradict each other then it is possible to derive anything. That is:

$P\land \neg P\vdash Q$

We can prove this. If \(P\) and \(\neg P\) are true, then the following is also true:

\(P\lor Q\)

We can then use \(P\lor Q\) and \(\neg P\) to imply \(Q\).

This works for any proposition \(Q\), including \(\neg Q\).

As we can derive \(Q\) and \(\neg Q\), our axioms are not consistent.
