\subsection{De Morgan's Laws}

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\neg (A\lor B)\Leftrightarrow (\neg A\land \neg B)\)
\item \(\neg (A\land B)\Leftrightarrow (\neg A\lor \neg B)\)
\end{itemize}

This expresses the duality of normal form.

Duality is the principle that binary operators have inverses, and when they are swapped with their inverse, the truth value of the statement is unaffected.
