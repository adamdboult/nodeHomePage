\subsection{Terms and predicates}

\subsubsection{Predicates}

Zero-order logic adds predicates. Like propositional variables, these have truth values. Unlike propositional variable, predicates take terms as inputs.

For example using propositional logic we can write the statement "you are 25" as \(\theta \).

With preterites we can write this as \(P(you, 25)\).

A propositional variable can be considered a special case of a predicate variable, where the number of inputs is \(0\).
