\subsubsection{Structures}

A logical structure consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Domain
\item Interpretation
\item Signature
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Domain}

The domain is the set of variables in the structure.

We include an infinite number of variables.

\subsubsection{Interpretation}

The interpretation assigns values to propositional and predicate variables.

\subsubsection{Signature}

A logical signature describes the language of the logic which is used to construct statements. This includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions
\item Relations
\item Operators
\end{itemize}

The language of a signature is all possible sentences, or formulae which can be constructed from this signature.

We include an infinite number of functions, relations and all operators.
