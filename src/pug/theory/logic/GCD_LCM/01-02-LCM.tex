\subsection{Multiples and Lowest Common Multiples (LCM)}

\subsubsection{Multiples}

The multiple of a number is it added to itself iteratively.

The multiples of \(18\) for example are:

\([18,36,54,72,90,...]\)

And for \(24\):

\([24,48,72,96,120,...]\)

\subsubsection{Common multiples}

\subsubsection{Lowest common multiple}

The lowest common multiple of \(2\) numbers is again as the name suggests.

So \(LCM(18,24)=72\).
