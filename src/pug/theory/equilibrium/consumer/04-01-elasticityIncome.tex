\subsection{Engel curves and income elasticity of demand}

The Engel curve shows demand for a good as a function of income.

Derivative
\(x_{di}=x_{di}(I, \mathbf p)\)

\(\dfrac{\delta }{\delta I}x_{di}(I, \mathbf p)\)

Income elasticity of demand
\(\xi_i =\dfrac{\delta x_{di}}{\delta I}\dfrac{I}{x_{di}}\)
