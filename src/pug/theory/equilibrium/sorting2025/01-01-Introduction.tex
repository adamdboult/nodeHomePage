\subsection{Big page: Portfolios}
\subsubsection{Portfolios}
Households have portfolios.

Includes cash, bonds, stocks

so what is value of current assets? We can plug this into the intertemporal choice constraint.

income at t is:

\(y_t=w_tl_t+A_t+()k_{t-1}+div_t\)

Where:

ul

li \(w_tl_t\) is wage income

li \(A_t\) is state contingent bond income

li \((r_tz_t-\Phi (z_t))k_{t-1}\) is the return on capital stock

li \(div_t\) is dividends at time \(t\)

\subsection{Capital dynamics (ECON)}
We have \(k_t\), capital it time \(t\).

What are the dynamics?

\(k_{t+1}=y(k_t)-c_t+(1-\delta )k_t\)

So capital is capital from before, depreciated, and the difference between output and consumption.
\subsubsection{Euler equation for capital}

\(u'(c_t)=\beta (1-\delta +f'(k_{t+1})u'(c+_{t+1}\)
