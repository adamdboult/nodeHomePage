\subsection{Stockpiling}

Let’s consider what happens if Alice tries to save money by producing more fish. If she uses the additional shells from this to buy more goods, she hasn’t saved. If she doesn’t sell them she hasn’t acquired any additional shells.

While building up stockpiles isn’t giving Alice more money now, the economy is producing more that it is consuming, and so this is an investment in the future.
