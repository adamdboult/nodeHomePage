\subsection{Treatment data}

\subsubsection{Recap}

With multilevel data with fixed coefficients we have:

\(y_{ij}=\mathbf x_{ij}\theta +m_j + \epsilon_{ij}\)

We can estimate \(m_j\) using fixed effects or similar methods.

\subsubsection{Treatment data}

If the data is grouped by whether an entity was treated then will have:

\begin{itemize}
\item \(y_{i0}\) - the outcome if the entity was not treated
\item \(y_{i1}\) - the outcome if the entity was treated
\end{itemize}

However we only observe \(y_i\) and \(D_i\).

\(y_i=y_{i0}+D_i(y_{i1}-y_{10})\)
