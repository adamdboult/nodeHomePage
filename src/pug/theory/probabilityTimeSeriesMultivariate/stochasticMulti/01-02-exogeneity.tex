\subsection{Exogeneity}

\subsubsection{Contemporaneous exogeneity}

\(Cov(x_{it},u_{it})=0\)

\subsubsection{Strict exogeneity}

\(Cov (x_{is}, u_{it})=0)\)

This is stronger than contemporeous, all periods.

Shocks don't affect future outcomes.

\subsubsection{Sequential exogeneity}

Sequential exogeneity: a bit looser than strict exogeneity. only holds when \(s\le t\).

So shocks can affect, but only in future.
