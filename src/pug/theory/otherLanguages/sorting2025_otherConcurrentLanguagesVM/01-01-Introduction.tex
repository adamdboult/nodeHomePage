\subsection{Introduction}
Dart: language with own VM. Can Cross compile to js. Has jit. "Isolate" is where stuff runs. Has concurrent with multiple isolates
erlang is functional, garbage collected, concurrent and uses vm. maybe after other concepts have been introduced?
Elixer: uses same virtual machine as Erlang (BEAM)
