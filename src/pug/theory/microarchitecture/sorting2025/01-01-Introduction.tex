\subsection{Introduction}

+ something on cache
  * SRAM (stochastic random-access memory) as opposed to DRAM (dynamic access memory) which is regular ram
  * part of the CPU in practice
  * in between register and DRAM

\subsection{Branch prediction}
Will a conditional jump be taken?

\subsection{Branch target prediction}
Predict where to go next

cpu out of order execution
