This adds new types of fixed width integers which won't vary by computer.

To recap, existing variables, such as int have a lower bound but not an upper bound, as such the behaviour can vary machine to machine.

The types are:

+ int8\_t: Signed 8 bit
+ uint8\_t: Unsigned 8 bit
+ Equivalents for 16, 32 and 64 bit (eg uint64).

The header also provides macros to indicate the min and max of these types, including eg INT8\_MIN, UINT64\_MAX.
