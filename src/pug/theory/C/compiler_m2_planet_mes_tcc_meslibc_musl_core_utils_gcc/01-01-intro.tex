\subsection{Using eg cc\_x86 to build m2-planet}

with cc\_* can build m2-planet, which can compile to different platforms. (m2 planet is c compiler?)

\subsection{Using m2-planet to build mes}

can use m2 planet to build mes (which can then self compile)

MesCC compiler (difference between this and tinycc?)

Which architectures does mescc support?

\subsection{Building tinycc (tcc) with mes}

Tiny C Compiler

Which architectures does tcc support?

can use mes to build tcc (which can then self compile)

More powerful than mescc

\subsection{Building meslibc}

can use mes to build meslibc

\subsection{Building musl}

can use tcc/meslibc to build musl

\subsection{Build core utils and gcc}

can use tcc/musl to build core utils/gcc
