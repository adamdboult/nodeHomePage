\subsection{enum}

\begin{verbatim}
enum flag {const1, const2, ..., constN};
const1 = 0 by default
\end{verbatim}

can do const1+1 etc

Changing default values of enum constants

\begin{verbatim}
enum suit {
    club = 0,
    diamonds = 10,
    hearts = 20,
    spades = 3,
};
\end{verbatim}

can initialse from enum
\begin{verbatim}
enum week day;
\end{verbatim}

or when defining
\begin{verbatim}
enum week{Mon, Tue, Wed}day;

day = Wed;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{CONST and modifiable lvalues}

use of "const" here? page? motivation? is it actually stored in memory or just compiled?

basically throws an error if you try to modify. still actually stored in memory. eg a function can take a const as an input. variable at compile time. const and run time.

distinction between unmodifiable lvalues and modifiable lvalues
\begin{verbatim}
const int a = 1;
a = 2; // bad, even though a is an lvalue.
\end{verbatim}
