\subsection{Single neuron}

Neurons have:

+ Dentrite (takes message from other neurons
+ Cell body
+ Axon

Charge across neuron is mediated by ions. Positive or negative.

If the dentrite is stimulated, then charge increases at that point. But large number of inputs to dentrite

If many stimulated, then overall charge can change.

\subsection{Two neurons}

When stimulated, the axon stimulates dentrites of other neurons.

Axons are connected to other neurons via synapses.

When axon is positively charged, it releases neurotransmitters into the synapse.

Receptors in the dentrite detect these and positive charge released in dentrite.

Neurotransmitters removed by reuptake into axon, or break down by enzyme in synapse.

Different types of neurotransmitter can be released by the same axon. Some short lasting, long lasting, inhibitors.

page on different types of neurotransmitters? seretonin, dopamine etc

\subsection{Hormones}

SSRI

testosterone
