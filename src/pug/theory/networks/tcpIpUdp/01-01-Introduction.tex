  * if a between 0 and 127 inclusiive, class A network
  * 127.0.0.1 reserved for local oopback. nothing else in 127 space
  * localhost alias
  * 128 to 191 is class B
  * 192 to 223 is class C. local networks
  * private includes 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
    1. 10.x.x.x
    2. 172.16-31.x.x
    3. 192.168.x.x

internet:
+ router has IP address on local network, eg 192.168.0.1
+ router has IP on internet too

ipv6 page
network address translation (NAT) page. aimed at resolving running out of ipv4
