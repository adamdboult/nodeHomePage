\subsection{Introduction}

Univar:
+ Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference.
+ How to form prior for bayes, computation complexity?

stochastic gradient descent somewhere
+ algorithms which use stats generally?

bounded-error probabilistic polynomial (BPP)
+ P is special case of BPP. don't use randomness
+ have access to random tape
+ required to be correct 2/3 of time

Zero-error probabilistic polynomial (ZPP)

Randomised polynomial (RP) time
+ if returns yes then definitiely yes, not case for no
+ Co-RP exists too

PP probabilistic polynomial
+ like BPP but error < 1/2 rather than < 1/3

post selection and BPP\_path

Jeffreys divergence (J-divergence)

The Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test (K-S test)

Conjugate priors:
If the prior \(P(\theta)\) and the posterior \(P(\theta | X)\) are in the same family of distributions (eg both Gaussian), then the prior and posterior are conjugate distributions

entropy: use \(E_i\) \(E_j\) language

in events, stuff on marginaliation, discrete continuous to variables h3

simple continous distribution split out: what is motivation, how do they arrive? this should indicate where is pdf they belong
+ for ones not taken out, move to h3 called probability to sort, page for each one


\subsection{exploratory data analysis}

in page on "testing population means", page on type 1, type 2 errors somewhere.null hypothesis, power of a test
