\subsection{Restricted Maximum Likelihood}

We can partition out Likelihood functions, and include a part only with variance.

\subsection{Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

\subsection{Scores}

Existing score: rename Maximum Likelihood score

MLE bad if true theta not at where score is 0

Eg if one sided tails, true theta is not at MLE condition.

Can we find other scores?

\subsection{Orthogonality}
Score of one parameter depends on other parameters

If we misestimate one, then estimate another, will be bad answer

We want the score not to change around bad estimates

We want nuisance parameter bias not to affect score

separate page for orthogonality for sets of parameters. eg nuisance; of interest
