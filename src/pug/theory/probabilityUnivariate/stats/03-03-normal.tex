\subsection{Asymptotic normality}

Many statistics are asymptotically normally distribution.

This is a result of the central limit theorem.

For example:

\(\sqrt n S\rightarrow^d N(s, \sigma^2) \)

\subsubsection{Confidence intervals for asymptotically normal statistics}

We have the mean and variance, and know the distribution. This allows us to calculare confidence intervals.
