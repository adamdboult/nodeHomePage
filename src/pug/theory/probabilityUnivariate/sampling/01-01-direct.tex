\subsection{Density estimation through direct sampling}

I THINK THE STUFF HERE IS LIMITATIONS TO REJECTION SAMPLING??

DIRECT SAMPLING IS DOING PHYSICAL SAMPLES, MANUALLY PICKING BALLS FROM URL ETC?

There is distribution \(P(x)\) which we want to know more about.

If the function was closed, we could estimate it by using values of \(x\).

\subsection{Limitations of direct sampling}

However if the function does not have such a form, we cannot do that.

We can't plug in values, because the function is complex.

Sometimes we may know a function of the form:

\(f(x)=cP(x)\)

That is, a multiple of the function.

This can happen from Bayes' theorem:

\(P(y|x)=\dfrac{P(x|y)P(y)}{P(x)}\)

We may be able to estimate \(P(x|y)\) and \(P(y)\), but not \(P(x)\)

This means be have 

\(P(y|x)=cP(x|y)P(y)\)
