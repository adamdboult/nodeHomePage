\subsection{Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER)}

What is the chance of making at least one false positive result?

Number of tests: \(m\)

Number of false positive results: \(V\)

\(FWER=P(V>0)\)

\subsection{False Discovery Rate (FDR)}

The proportion of false discoveries is:

\(Q=\frac{V}{V+S}\)

Where:
\(V\) is the number of false positives

\(S\) is the number of true positives

The FRD is \(E[Q]\).

\subsection{The Bonferroni correction}

We change the significance level.

reject if \(p\le \frac{\alpha }{m}\)

If \(m=1\) this is the standard test.
