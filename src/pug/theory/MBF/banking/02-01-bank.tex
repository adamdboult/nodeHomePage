\subsection{Banks}

Banks get revenue from their lending activities. Their costs include identifying investment opportunities and paying interest to depositors.

Is the bank system more wasteful because it has reserves? Not really â€“ reserves are needed because the bank deposits are on demand. If Alice received funds directly from each one she would keep some in reserve herself, in case someone demanded money back. What the bank does is:

\begin{itemize}
\item Make identifying investment opportunities simpler
\item Matching short term depositors with long term borrowers
\end{itemize}


If Alice puts some of the money lent to her in the bank, this could have been lent out, recursively.

\(Total money supply = \dfrac{Base money}{Reserve ratio}\)

The \(money multiplier\), the ratio of total money supply to base money is equal to \(\dfrac{1}{Reserve ratio}\)
