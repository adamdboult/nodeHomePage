\subsection{Limit of a sequence}

A sequence converges to a limit if

Can converge to a number (1/x)

Can converge to +/- infinity (x)

Otherwise, does not converge (1,-1,1,-1â€¦)

Superior and inferior limits

A bounded increasing sequence converges to least upper bound

\subsubsection{Identifying the limit of a sequence}

Direct comparison test

Root test
