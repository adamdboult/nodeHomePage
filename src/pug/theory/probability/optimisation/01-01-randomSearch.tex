\subsection{Random search}

We start with a random set of parameters, \(x\).

We then loop through the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item We define a search space local to our current selection.
\item We randomly select a point from this space.
\item We compare the new point to our current point. If the new point is better we move to that.
\end{itemize}
