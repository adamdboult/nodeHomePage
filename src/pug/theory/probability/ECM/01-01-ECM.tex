\subsection{Error Correction Model}

\subsubsection{Static model}

Like PAM we start with static estimator.

\subsubsection{The ECM}

The ECM does a regression with first differences, and includes lagged error terms.

We start with a basic first-difference model. 

\(\Delta y_t= \Delta x_t\)

We could also expand this to include laggs for both x and y. Here we don't.

We know that long term \(y_t=\theta x_t\). We use the error from this in a first difference model. 

\(\Delta y_t= \alpha \Delta x_t + \beta (y_{t-1}-\theta x_{t-1})\)
