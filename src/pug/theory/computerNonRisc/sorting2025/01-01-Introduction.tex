\subsection{Introduction}

cisc:
+ When discussing cisc, discuss "register memory" as alternative to "Load store". "CISC and the register-memory architecture"?
+ register memory architecture allows operations on memory as well as registers

\subsection{CISC}
op codes can take many clocks built from simpler instructions
+ actually this applies to risc too. point is other things right? different instruction lengths, direct RAM access in operations
