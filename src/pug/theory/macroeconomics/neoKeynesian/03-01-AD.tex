\subsection{Aggregate Demand (AD)}

For any given price level there is a corresponding IS-LM equilibrium, with an output level.

The Aggregate Demand curve models the relationship between the price level and equilibrium output.

As the price level rises, the real money supply falls. This means nominal interest rates rise to ensure LM equilibrium.

This rise in interest rates causes the IS curve to shift inwards, reducing output.
